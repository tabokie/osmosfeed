          "description": "前段时间发现一篇参考引用相当夸张，谈游戏设计的论文。这篇名为《Designing Game Feel. A Survey》的论文严格来说是一个文献综述。我转给别的同事时，评论说引用部分比正文还要有价值，因为帮助梳理了有关“Game Feel”设计许多重要文献的出处，可以通过这篇论文来按图索骥，根据实际开发需求进行个别的深入研究。 \n论文的正文部分并不是很长，17页，其中跟游戏设计有直接关系的，也是干货比较多的部分可以从第七页看起来。下面是一些简单的概述，帮助自己读完之后巩固一下印象，也帮助大家定位到需要参考的部分。\n\n对于术语部分，除了已经约定俗成的，我还是尽量用英文原文。\n\n首先要说，“Game Feel Design”这个词不是很好翻译，不能简单的翻译成“设计游戏感”，这样没有什么意义，也并非“手感”，手感只是其中一部分，按照作者自己的定义： \nGame feel design is minute design work that evokes affect.
