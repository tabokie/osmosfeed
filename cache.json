          "description": "A recent LinkedIn post tried to illustrate in graphic form some old bunk that had been debunked to death decades ago: the purported inferiority of relational relative to directed graph database management. The plethora of \"Great viewpoint!\", \"great representation\", \"love this!\", \"like\", \"Nice!, \"Very clever!\" reactions it triggered confirm the lack of foundation knowledge and familiarity with history of the field in the industry, without which there cannot be any progress. I will not waste any time debunking it. Instead, I will use a quote by a participant in the exchange from a Date and Darwen (D&D) book to bring up an important insight by David McGoveran.\n\n“Overall, we believe the most appropriate design will emerge if careful consideration is given to the distinction between (a) declarative sentences in natural language, on the one hand, and (b) the vocabulary used in the construction of such sentences on the other. As we showed in Chapter 2 (but simplifying slightly here), it is unencapsulated tuples in relations that stand for those sentences, and it is encapsulated domain values in attributes in those tuples that stand for particular elements — typically nouns — in that vocabulary. To say it slightly differently (and to repeat what we said in Chapter 2, albeit in different words): Domains, or types, give us values that represent things we might wish to make statements about; relations give us ways of making those statements. Consider once again the EMP relvar of Design R. Suppose that relvar includes the tuple:\nTUPLE {EMP# 'E7',ENAME 'Amy',DEPT# 'D5',SALARY MONEY(60000)}\nThe existence of this tuple in the relvar means, by definition, that the database includes something that assert  that the following declarative sentence (statement) is true:\nEmployee E7, named Amy, is assigned to department D5 and earns a salary of $60,000.\"",

In robotics, physics simulations provide a safe and inexpensive virtual playground for robots to acquire physical skills with techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, as the hand-derived physics in simulations does not match the real world exactly, control policies trained entirely within simulation can fail when tested on real hardware — a challenge known as the sim-to-real gap or the domain adaptation problem.

These contrastive learning approaches typically teach a model to pull together the representations of a target image (a.k.a., the “anchor”) and a matching (“positive”) image in embedding space, while also pushing apart the anchor from many non-matching (“negative”) images. Because labels are assumed to be unavailable in self-supervised learning, the positive is often an augmentation of the anchor, and the negatives are chosen to be the other samples from the training minibatch.

          "description": "如果有一个在恋爱游戏中成为律政佳人的机会，你会尝试吗？\n《未定事件簿》恰好能满足这个愿望。作为一款恋爱推理手游，玩家会扮演新人律师，在近未来背景下与四位男主角组成NXX调查组，接下案件委托，通过调查在抽丝剥茧中还原真相。这些看似毫无关联的案件都与违禁成分NXX有关，背后涉及庞大而复杂的势力纠葛。\n本文试图从推理部分和恋爱部分两个方面来聊聊游戏体验，重点是玩法怎样与剧情结合，以带给玩家更多沉浸感。\n\n错综复杂的案件与艰深人心\n在《未定事件簿》主线第四章开始处，由玩家扮演的律师女主角向直接上级左然申请，正式加入他所在的NXX调查组，与本作中的其他三位男主角共同寻找证据，以指证利用NXX这一违禁品进行制药实验并投入市场，造成大量精神异常和器官衰竭患者的犯罪行为。\n这一选择是本作的重要节点。\n虽然玩家能够猜到，这是女主角注定会选择的路，但前期经历一系列危险和冲击后，女主角选择加入NXX调查组的契机更加显示出女主角强烈的悲悯之心和由此带来的精神力量。\n\n\n\n\n在左然同意她的申请后，她立刻切换到NXX成员的状态，询问左然自己是否也需要一个代号，其行动力可见一斑。\n主线剧情中，女主角的行为也处处昭示着她身上所具有的品质。无论是打开仓库的消防控制系统将队友从搏斗中及时救出，还是利用囚徒困境的知识使两名罪犯分别指认对方的犯罪行为从而获知真相，抑或是在极限情况下找到档案室中的锤子砸碎关押队友的透明玻璃柜，都让人感受到她鲜明的性格特征。作为一名女性都市白领，她在体力上丝毫不占优势，更多是凭借敏锐的观察力、清晰的逻辑和危机时刻由坚定信念催生出的勇气来完成调查，十分契合她在组内的代号“蔷薇”，不同于外表的柔弱，蔷薇是很坚强的花卉。\n\n\n\n\n在案件接连被侦破的过程中，推理玩法和主线剧情之间相辅相成。蔷薇在与陪同角色的讨论中，通过寻找证词与证物之间的矛盾，或是证词与证词之间的矛盾完成推理，提出猜想，之后…",

          "description": "《战地风云 2042》设计总监 Daniel Berlin 于日前接受了 Epic 游戏商城的采访，开发者揭晓了就这款《战地风云》系列有史以来规模最大游戏的开发、设计、各种灵感的详情，同时还确认预告中有玩家未发现的彩蛋，要点如下：\n\n\n<内嵌内容，请到原网页查看>\n\nDaniel Berlin 表示，游玩预告片中的确有些东西是他们尚未揭晓的。他个人期待看到玩家社群通过分析预告片的每一帧，对预告片进行剖析。有鉴于全新的地图以及128名玩家同台竞技， 所以工作室也必须使用全新的方式进行关卡设计。\n\n\n其内部,他们将这种方式叫做群集（Clustering）——先打造出地图上那些格外具有特色的、充满了各种资源和物品资源的区域，比如在体育馆这张地图上，整个馆内有多个要点需要占领，而要彻底占领体育馆，玩家就需要通过战斗，打穿好几个这样的战略要点，而这种方式实际上是基于前作的经验。\n\n\nDaniel Berlin 指出，从始至终，团队一直追求的都是沙盒化。沙盒化一直是《战地》的核心 DNA 的核心部分。本作是一款沙盒射击游戏，为了向玩家提供这些巨大的游玩空间，开发者要用到手头各种不同的工具，而现在拜最新的科技所赐，这些工具也进行了现代化的更新。\n\n\n当将这些要素全部融入同一个巨大战场时，《战地风云》的特色就奠定了。比如，战场上有一队步兵在移动，但同时也会有坦克，天上有喷气机，还有直升飞机。当这些用全新科技翻新的要素与巨大的地图互相结合时，它们就会相互交融，并创造出一种玩起来符合《战地风云》系列游戏风格的游玩体验。  \n值得一提的是，虽然没有单人游玩的战役，开发团队将仍旧通过在线服务，为大家呈现一个引人入胜的故事，我们将通过逐步推出的各类专家来向大家展现这个不断进化的世界中的故事。哪怕玩家只想单人游玩，也能通过和 AI 士兵对战进行体验。当然，同时也可以和朋友以及 AI 一起对战 AI。\n \n\n\n关于反作弊，Daniel Berlin 则强调称，让玩家们享受无骚扰，无作弊的游戏体验对他们至关重要。在 EA 内部有一个名叫 Positive Play 的系统，而《战地风云 2042》也将加入这个系统。工作室也将于未来提供有关于诸如跨平台游玩之类的更多信息。 \n在谈到打造这个未来和真实性兼备的浸入式体验时，Daniel Berlin 指出他们设定舞台和这些要点简直是严丝合缝，不管是从时间，还是名称的角度来说均是如此。然而他们同时还想打造一个我们的特种兵们能够存在，并具有有趣的背景故事的世界。他们还想将这个动态的世界的潜能发挥到极限，做一些离经叛道的事情，比如，彻底摒弃创意限制，跳出固化的思维。",

          "description": "在当代的生活中，相比于大街小巷中唾手可得的啤酒而言，葡萄酒更多地出现在宴请以及社交场合。作为酒精饮料的一员，葡萄酒从刚刚诞生起就被当时的贵族奉为了座上宾，似乎天生就被赋予了婆罗门的光环。从古埃及留存的壁画中，我们也可以一窥当时的权贵们对于葡萄酒的喜爱。\n\n(《乌尔王军旗》，描述了5000年前苏美尔人的生活)\n在军旗的最上面一列中，我们不难看出这是群臣向君主敬酒的场景，而他们手中的酒杯中盛满的极有可能便是出自初期苏美尔原始工艺的葡萄酒，因为乌尔城（现伊拉克地区）并非葡萄酒产地，只有由两河流域进口葡萄酿制的葡萄酒才有资格登上大雅之堂。公元前2000年后，葡萄酒作为商品加入了古埃及与古希腊的贸易往来，再经由古希腊传入了整个欧洲，其中也自然包括了《酿造物语》的故事发生地，意大利。\n\n(游戏中玩家的葡萄园所在的位置，请忽略笔者的酒庄名字)\n\n(现实中位于意大利西北部的阿尔巴小镇)\n意大利人将葡萄的种植方式大体分成两类：一种是让葡萄藤依附于其他树木进行生长，而另一种则是令其依附于木桩进行生长。到了近现代后，随着农业以及科学的不断进步，让葡萄藤攀附在人工搭建的支架上成为了更为合理的选择，坚固的支架不仅能为藤蔓起到稳定的支撑作用，也能在一定程度上控制葡萄的生长趋势，让其获得的日照更为充足。如今的葡萄园也多数采取这样的种植策略，《酿造物语》中玩家的葡萄园，无疑也是如此。\n\n(玩家需要照顾到种植园的方方面面)\n在《酿造物语》这款游戏里，玩家需要扮演一位对葡萄酒一无所知的普通人，从零开始经营起属于自己的葡萄园。在一次又一次的尝试中，玩家在体验经营葡萄园乐趣的同时，也能逐步学习到葡萄酒基本的酿造过程以及围绕葡萄本身的一些知识。\n这一期，我们就从后往前，先给大伙讲一讲葡萄酒的五维和它们之间的联系。\n\n(笔者第一次酿出来的葡萄酒，好像还行？)\n\n评价葡萄酒的五个维度\n 1. 酒体 \n酒体（body）这个词第一眼读上去非常的抽象，我们可以简单地把它理解为葡萄酒的浓郁程度。要打个比方的话，汤的浓度和酒体的概念有一定相似的地方，喜欢喝牛奶的朋友也可以想象一下脱脂和全脂牛奶口感之间存在的差异。\n除酒体以外的特征都会对酒体本身造成一定程度的影响。甜度，单宁和酒精都会增加葡萄酒的酒体，而酸度则会降低酒体。\n\n\n2.甜度 \n顾名思义，甜度（sweetness）衡量的就是一瓶葡萄酒经过发酵后剩余的含糖量。\n通常来说，甜度越高的酒也越粘稠，而我们常听到的干型，甜型也与甜度有直接的联系。 从甜度从低到高排序（括号内为每升中含多少克糖）： \n\n极干型 Bone Dry（<1g/L) \n干型Dry（1~17g/L） \n半干型Off-Dry（17~35g/L） \n半甜型Medium Sweet（35~120g/L） \n甜型Sweet（>120g/L)\n\n\n3. 单宁 \n葡萄酒中最值得称道的成分就是单宁（Tannin），因为其有抑制胆固醇以及降低脂肪肝等对功效，使得人们对葡萄酒大为赞赏。当然，过量饮用葡萄酒肯定是有害的。\n单宁的特点就是它苦涩的味道，主要的来源是葡萄皮和葡萄籽，对于葡萄酒的酿造而言，它们也能起到减缓氧化以及维持葡萄酒稳定性的作用。佳丽酿酒一般是葡萄酒中涩度最低的，而最高的则是萨格兰蒂诺酒。用啤酒来作为对比的话，IPA，双倍IPA以及三倍IPA大约可以概括单宁在上述例子中的跨度。 \n\n\n4. 酸度 \n酸度（acidity）同样是一个直白的指标。首先我们要明确一个概念，没有不酸的葡萄酒，只有没那么酸的和更酸的。酸度比较低的葡萄酒品尝起来会比较甜，酒体也更加饱满。相对的，酸度较高的葡萄酒更为轻盈和苦涩许多。不恰当的酸度往往会导致葡萄酒的味道失去特点或者过于强烈，一瓶优秀的葡萄酒通常都会在酸度上取得一个较好的平衡。 \n\n\n5. 酒精 \n葡萄酒的酒精含量通常在15%左右，甜度越高的葡萄酒中酒精的含量可能越高。由于酒精的含量不好在酿造过程中精确量化，在游戏中制作方引入了“典型性”这样一个名词，用来形容玩家酿出来的酒在当地所有同类酒中具有代表性，想必他们也做了许多实地考察（指品尝大量葡萄酒）。这也从侧面评价了玩家对葡萄酒酿造的掌握程度。 \n以上就是第一期关于葡萄酒的内容啦！下一期我们会梳理一遍葡萄酒的酿造过程！对《酿造物语》感兴趣的朋友也可以去商店页面看看这款游戏是否合自己的胃口！  \n\n\n<内嵌内容，请到原网页查看>\n\n\n\n<内嵌内容，请到原网页查看>\n\n本文内容引用： \n看图学葡萄酒 - 玛德琳帕克特，贾斯汀海默克 \n葡萄酒的故事 - 休约翰逊",

          "description": "Demo不能代表游戏质量，但是当它的Demo都那么好玩的时候，你就知道这个游戏是有多好了。\n序言\nDemo版本只有两个Class，也就是士兵、盾哥。Demo里他们的技能也跟1代有所不同，但是定位都是一样的。具体机制有什么变化现在讲了估计后面还是会改的，所以就不考究了。\n\n\n画面，基础体验\n最先进入我们视野的是游戏更新的3d画面，效果如何且看截图。而优化问题，我可以说我的1060不能在最高画质下稳定60帧，但是能够忍受。毕竟2代切换到Unity引擎（应该是）总比1代的软件稳定性要高。\n操作、打击感个人体验跟1代类似，但是视野变大，瞄准需要更多时间适应，而场景复杂起来，障碍物也多了，弹道怎么走也是个眼花花的问题。\n\n\n这次敌人被打爆会各种布娃娃碎尸，有蓝色的能量护盾视觉特效。一个明显的问题是，部分敌人死亡后，例如机甲，机甲的残骸掉在地上会挡住去路以及弹道，残骸依然有生命值，可以被打爆。但是现在的敌人AI并不会主动去打爆挡住路的残骸，而且敌人掉落的物品会卡在残骸里面。\n当然敌人蹦数字，伤害溢出爆大红叉叉还是保留了的。\nDemo的敌人种类完全不输1代，有近战（这是2代新增的）有远程狙击有敌方盾哥……还有新增的机器狗。\n\n(地形杀变得特别有意思，这个是什么电磁通道之类的)\n游戏战斗操作起来跟前作变化并不大，1代的经验完全可以移植过来。不过热量条未免暗了点。地图依然随机，但是有明显向某个目标前进的感觉。从基地外面打入基地内部，再由电梯前往深处。\n昏暗的地图，有气氛，更加能体验光影特效，但是准星看不见。\n\n\n3d化带来的一切\n从2d纸片人变3d游戏，整个游戏的动画数量跟1代相比完全不是一个量级的，对比一代几乎只有上弹动作比较复杂，2代各种加速跑动、退后射击、移动射击的复杂动画都有体现，可谓是豪华。而新加入的z轴可谓是超维度地丰富了游戏本身。\n游戏里有了垂直体验，世界不再是平的。\n但是作为一个俯视角射击游戏，1代的hitbox问题，也就是子弹命中判定的问题延续到了2代。你觉得打中了它就是打不中，2代的这个demo里最为直观的例子是里面的小型炮塔。小型炮塔的模型类似于三脚架摄像机，而炮管才是本体，也就是说看起来那么大的一个东西，你要是打不中他三脚架中间那个小块块，它就是没有反应。反观大型炮塔，一个长方体盒子，打哪儿都中。\n这在《Synthetik》的游戏机制里，是个非常严重的问题。《Synthetik》里决定敌人强度的关键实际上不仅仅在于敌人的血量，由于《Synthetik》的每场1对1小型战斗的时间都非常短，敌我的“击杀时间”都不长，能否命中敌人的这一因素对战斗的影响与武器伤害几乎处于同等地位。\n\n\n\n(蜜汁高低差)\n很明显建筑物挡住东西老生常谈的问题，不知道正式版要怎么改动。 这次它挡住的东西更加多了，3d俯视角还是挺能折腾人的直觉的。总不能指望改成TPS或者是FPS吧？\n\n\n另外，Demo里的商店有妹子，怎么能有妹子？如此堕落的行为，必须批判！\n\n(女人！是女人！啊啊啊啊)\n总而言之，喜欢1代玩不够，2代不玩没道理。\n8月开放EA测试，射击，卸弹夹，装填，射击！",

          "description": "在今天凌晨微软来了 Xbox&贝塞斯达发布会后的 Xbox Games Showcase Extended 游戏演示与开发者详解直播，期间公布了《地狱之刃2 塞纳传奇》全新幕后制作与概念设计预告，《盗贼之海》与《加勒比海盗》联动的全新预告片“盗贼之海：A Pirate's Life”，我们将在其中与 Jack Sparrow 船长一同踏上全新的冒险，面对众多敌人与未知的宝藏。Xbox Design Lab 也正式推出了 Xbox Series X/S 手柄自定义服务。\n\n\n<内嵌内容，请到原网页查看>\n(全程官方中文字幕)\n首先，来自 PlayGround 的 Mike Brown 带来了将于11月9日正式发售的《极限竞速：地平线5》。游戏中除了将包含全部真实的墨西哥地貌与赛道外，PlayGround 更是捕捉了超过400小时的 12K HDR 天空数据，力求为玩家带来最真实的天气体验。此外，在《极限竞速：地平线5》中的 EventLab 将成为玩家和社区之间最受欢迎的创作与游玩场所，大家可以在该模式下设计任何你能想象到的东西，并设置游玩规则，所有玩家都能尽情享受该模式。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n《极限竞速：地平线5》将于11月9日正式登陆 Xbox Series X/S、Win 10 商店、Steam 以及 Xbox Game Pass。拥有 XGP 订阅的玩家可以在游戏发售后的第一时间内开始游玩，如果你再加购或者直接购买 Premium 扩展包，则可以比购入其他版本的玩家提前一点玩到游戏。\n随后，来自 Ninja Theory 的“创意忍者”Tameem 带来了《地狱之刃2 塞纳传奇》的最新开发进度介绍与创意预告。Tameem 表示，团队目前正在制作游戏中最重要的一部分，然后再进入全面开发阶段。而这款作品对他们来说非常特殊，开发组并不想做一款很直接的续作，而是想作更特别的东西。\n\n\n<内嵌内容，请到原网页查看>\n\n据介绍，游戏背景设定在公元九世纪的冰岛，所以整个艺术团队都来到了冰岛进行拍摄于湿地摄影测量，对景观进行了大范围的重建。而在战斗方面，新作中将更加残酷且真实，女主演 Milena 为此还接受了两年的训练。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble Fine 工作室的 Tim Schafer 带来了《脑航员2》的游玩演示与讲解，在本作中，我们将进入更多的大脑，其中前作反派 Caligosto Loboto 就包含在其中。在他被Raz打败后，算是互相成为了朋友。但他知道到底是谁绑架了 Truman Zanotto，可潜意识却阻止他向 Raz 透露任何消息。\n\n\n\n\n我们在《脑航员 2》中将会发现谁给Raz家族下了诅咒，并探索脑航员的总部：母叶。《脑航员 2》将于8月25日正式登陆 Xbox Series X/S、PC、PlayStation 5 和 Xbox One 平台。\n\n\n《潜行者 2》在直播活动上带了游玩演示详解，官方表示，游戏的全名为《潜行者 2 切尔诺贝利之心》，游戏将于4月28日正式发售同步加入 Xbox Game Pass。\n\n\n\n\n《战地 2042》透露了部分“全面战争体验”模式的信息。其中包含海陆空所有战场，一并组成了一个大型战争。其内部再细分则包含“征服模式”与“突围模式”。在征服模式中，所有玩家将参与到一场十分庞大的沙盒式战斗中，当你们赢得战斗后，就能选择下一步想要前往的战场，通过运输车来到新的地区进行战斗。大家可以自由选择什么时候前往什么地点进行战斗。\n\n\n\n\n而突围模式将加入更多的执导内容，我们将在一整张地图上展开战斗，玩家被分为进攻与防守队。而战场被压缩为特定空间的正面战斗，行动时间非常短暂。\n\n\n随后 Jack Sparrow 船长正式登场，在该免费更新中我们将穿梭于《盗贼之海》与《加勒比海盗》两个世界之中，探寻《加勒比海盗》世界中的经典场景，与幽灵船员和嗜血海妖进行战斗，除此之外，千万不要忘了戴维琼斯正驾驶着“飞翔的荷兰人”正紧随其后。\n\n\n<内嵌内容，请到原网页查看>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n343 Industries 也带来了《光环 无限》多人模式的详细介绍，其中我们在预告片中看到的女性角色，她是斯巴达学院负责人 Laurette 指挥官。《光环 无限》将于2021年假期在 PC、Xbox One 及 Xbox Series X | S 发售，首日登录 XGP。其多人对战模式将免费面向所有玩家。并将持续带来季度更新与全新模式、地图，以及以社区为中心的游戏内容。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n最后，《猩红结系》带来了游戏背后的深度玩法设计介绍，更多详情请看直播全程中文字幕录像。",

          "description": "导语\n自微软宣布将于6月24日举办网络发布会以来，有关 Windows 11 的传言就不绝于耳。出乎不少人预料的是，被誉为最后一代的 Windows 10 将于2025年退休，而“十年来最重要的更新”将会以 Windows 11  的形式呈现。\n笔者也于近日体验了面向了开发者的早期构造版本，下面也和各位读者朋友聊聊新系统的一些亮点。\n\n\n<内嵌内容，请到原网页查看>\n\n全新Fluent Design\n\n\n笔者认为， Windows 11 的最大变化要属全面使用 Fluent Design 的 UI ，而这点从安装向导开始就相当明显。除了全面拥抱圆角设计以及全新的音效设计之外，全新设计的开始菜单、壁纸以及图标也确实给人眼前一亮的感觉。\n需要注意的是，Windows 11 中任务栏默认居中，但用户也可通过设置改回传统样式。\n\n\nFluent Design 作为一种强调光线、深度、动画、材质与尺度的设计语言，与纯扁平化有着很大区别。正如下图所见，Windows 11 的设计语言相对传统扁平化而言更为强调质感、阴影，在使用得当的情况搭配亚克力效果也相当亮眼。\n\n(传统扁平化对比Fluent Design )\n比较遗憾的是，目前版本的 Windows 11 中仍然存在控制面板与设置的割裂情况（仅图标进行了更新），而这点也相当干扰用户的日常体验。尽管 Windows 一贯的强大兼容性对于所有人都是好事，但横跨两个版本仍然没有把所有选项整合至一起也让人颇感不解。同时，全新设计尽管看起来很美，但如同 Windows 10 一样，仍有不少地方需要加强。比如，选项卡的信息量要比传统设计低不少，无论是 Xbox 还是微软商城应用也一如既往的易用性偏低等等。这些也是笔者希望在正式版中微软能够优化的内容。\n任务视图与小组件\n在 Windows 11 中，微软强化了任务视图功能，同时还首次加入了名为小组件的图标。\n任务视图是一个在 Windows 10 中首次引入的任务切换器和虚拟桌面系统，允许用户快速定位到已打开的窗口，快速隐藏所有窗口并显示另一个桌面，以及管理多个监视器或虚拟桌面上的窗口。尽管这一功能相当有用，但对于一些用户来说也太过复杂，而本次微软也特意简化了用户的操作难度，从而让更多用户体验这项功能。\n\n\n就本次技术预览的体验而言，新增的小组件与 Windows 10 中的“资讯与兴趣”十分类似。在小组件中，用户可以查看最新天气、阅读故事以及信息流。正如同“资讯与兴趣”，除了查看天气之外目前的用处可以说是不大。\n\n\n除了任务视图与小组件之外，用户还可自定义开始菜单中的常用图标以及经常使用应用。同时，通过鼠标摇晃窗口来最小化其他程序功能的功能现在也可以在设置中进行关闭。\n最后，存储感知还新增了“游戏”、“家庭”、“创意工作”等预设，用户可选择最符合自己电脑使用的情景，Windows 根据这些情景进行优化。\n\n\n结语\n以技术预览版来看，Windows 11 相对而言是一次稳健保守的升级。根据 Linus Tech Tips 的测试，无论是游戏还是日常软件的运行都毫无问题，相信届时的正式升级也将是一次顺滑无缝的体验。当然，目前版本还远非正式版本，也很期待微软会在发布会中揭晓的更多全新功能以及设计。\n\n\n\n\n除了新增内容之外，笔者还注意到 Windows 11 自带了 Xbox 游戏应用，这也代表玩家将首次无需下载额外应用便可直接体验 Xbox Game Pass 游戏。依笔者之见，对微软自家游戏的整合也印证着微软在此领域的野心以及愿景。\n笔者最后也要强调，不推荐读者使用该早期构造版本的 Windows 11 作为日常使用的系统，不仅目前中文支持不完全，安全性也得不到保障。",

          "description": "Maker Stations based in sunny Leith, Edinburgh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿\n\nI love WFH. Offices can be fun in their way, but I always struggled to focus in a noisy, open environment. That (and a famous virus thing that made us stuck at our homes) prompted me to look for some desk inspiration.\n\nI had a blast browsing home office setups & battle stations on Reddit, but… I always wanted to learn more about the insights and the makers behind them. Pictures just weren’t enough.\n\nThis frustration led me to launch Maker Stations (using an incredibly fast Ghost platform!), a blog dedicated to home offices and mindful living: www.makerstations.io 🏠👨‍💻\n\nWe curate beautiful & functional home office setups from makers around the globe, and, most importantly, feature stories of people behind them🎙️\n\nI run Maker Stations together with my partner in crime @elenailford (she’s an amazing editor and hopeless introvert). We hope our blog will inspire you to upgrade your home office, build one from scratch or flick through the setups and look at the photos from those who did.\n\nWe’d appreciate it if you could spread the word about our blog with whoever might find it useful: friends, colleagues or fellow makers 👊\n\nGet updates on Twitter, Instagram and consider subscribing to our weekly newsletter.\n\nNow, let’s go and make something happen!\n\nCheers,\nIlya\n        ”\n        \nDiscussion\n        |\n        Link",

          "description": "⌛ Background \nEverybody in Berlin has stories when it comes to flat-hunting. It involves weird characters, strange situations. Those stories are comedic in nature, but they also tell a lot about the difficult housing market here.\n\nHaving heard a lot of them over the years, I decided to turn them into a game. 🙌\n\n👤Who is behind this\nI'm the one behind the original idea, concept and writing. This is because since 10 years, I'm also a blogger with settle-in-berlin.com. I help newcomers move to Germany/Berlin with guides on how to beat local bureaucracy. (read more about me here)\n\nI was helped by my brother, who is a game designer. He did all the coding.\nWe hired pixel artists for some of the art, and did the rest ourselves.\n\n📣What's the point/message?\nWith rent prices nearly doubling since 2011, flat-hunting in Berlin has become increasingly competitive and depressing. I wanted to create a catharsis for people to have fun with our common frustration.\n\nI also wanted to pointed out some hard truths like the fact that people with foreign-sounding names have less chances to get a flat than people with German names. I also wanted to talk about choices made by the city that really impacted negatively the housing market for tenants.\n\n💡Inspiration\nApart from the obvious arcade titles:\n- Secret of Monkey Island's swordfighting\n- Toggle.io's @Unicorn Startup Simulator\n\nHave fun with it and tell me what your score is! 🏆\n        ”\n        \nDiscussion\n        |\n        Link",

The rocks locate the site high above the water's edge and a series of steps and easily accessible ramps lead the visitor through the sloped inside of the site. The pathways interlink, creating a parcour with rendezvous points adding emphasis to these junctions.  The topography of the site allows the surrounding landscape to be experienced as a panorama, with the site itself visible from afar, like a rock amongst water.",

Through this strategy, \"Medial Surfaces\" are derived by controlling axial lines which eliminates direct control over the surface's geometry.",

Either way, they often result in buildings that appear both heavy and light at the same time and they present safely precarious situations for their inhabitants. The video describes what cantilevers are as well as some of the structural principles which govern their design like tension, compression, moment, and shear. It also goes over some great examples by architects like MVRDV, Rem Koolhaas, Ensemble Studio, and Richard Rogers. Finally, it concludes with appreciation for structural engineers and lists a few of the ones responsible for some of the most daring of delicate dangles.",

Translation: the very actual and misused topic of borders, peripheries, nations dictating conventions on one side of a line against what might happen on the other. Lines: suggested by a deformed, half invisible grid offering potential narratives of referential diversity, blurring north-south orientations. Geography: an insinuated three-dimensional space grid eludes any clear belonging. Choice: “if I had to choose between The Doors and Dostoyevsky, then – of course – I’d choose Dostoyevsky. But do I have to choose?” (Susan Sontag in Jonathan Cott, The Complete Rolling Stone Interview, Yale University Press, 2013).",

Ultimately, I found that the landscape I had chosen to document changed, not only seasonally, but by the hour.\n \nI chose to focus on the view from the lake where I lived at the time. There, I realized that the transformations I’d always assumed took place slowly, actually happened in measurable increments I could miss, if I looked away for too long. Ice formed and melted, altering the water from midnight to noon. In a matter of minutes, sudden winds whipped the lake’s glassy, reflective surface into frothing waves. If the sky opened up, or dark storm clouds rolled in to create a change of light, I made my way down the winding path (often running) from my house to the lake, camera in hand. \n\nOver the 20 months I spent on this project, I became more and more aware of the ever-changing light in the North. \n\nI noticed how even subtle changes elicited an entirely different mood from the landscape. I became obsessed with visiting the lake and seeing what it had to show me.Website ︎︎︎ ︎\n\tClick ︎",

Hoberman</a> finds it “as witty, gimlet-eyed, and discomfiting as when it won a special award at the 1987 Sundance Film Festival.” It’s also “an anticapitalist critique that has scarcely dated.” Molly (Louise Smith) is a photographer who turns trick at a Manhattan brothel to make ends meet. “Is it all worth it?” asks <a href=\"http://4columns.org/balsom-erika/working-girls\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Erika Balsom</a> at 4Columns. “Costs and benefits make up the calculus of survival, and <i>Working Girls</i> is all about keeping track of the ever-changing tally, without passing judgment.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><ul><li>Before the Berlinale wraps this weekend, a special Teddy Award will be presented to <a href=\"http://blog.teddyaward.tv/en/2021/05/28/special-teddy-award-goes-to-jenni-olson/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Jenni Olson,</a> a filmmaker, curator, and historian who, as the Teddy Foundation puts it, “embodies, lives, and creates queer film culture.” Best known for her essay films <i>The Joy of Life</i> (2005) and <i>The Royal Road</i> (2015), both of which are available on the <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/films-by-jenni-olson\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Criterion Channel,</a> Olson has spent decades putting together programs of vintage 35 mm movie trailers and gathering prints, negatives, digital masters, and production and distribution documentation related to LGBTQ cinema. The <a href=\"https://harvardfilmarchive.org/collections/jenni-olson-queer-film-collection/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Film Archive</a> acquired her collection last summer. “I know it’s the industry side of it,” she tells <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/15/jenni-olson-i-remember-walking-out-of-the-movie-theatre-like-yeah-im-a-cowboy\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Gilbey</a> in the <i>Guardian,</i> “connecting filmmakers and festivals and distributors and all that, but it’s also been all about friendship.

The duo has “just enough awkward chemistry to foster hopes for their burgeoning romance.” But <i>Merrily</i> is “Arzner’s most ambivalent film about marriage, right up to its uncomfortable last scene, which makes a mockery of the idea of a happy ending.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><ul><li>In the Spring 2017 issue of the Cine-Files, <a href=\"http://www.thecine-files.com/scenes-from-parallel-lives/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Wiles</a> wrote about Marguerite Duras and Jacques Rivette as “mavericks within the respective domains of film and literature from which they had emerged in the 1950s. As filmmakers, they were united in their mutual desire to conceive of a new relationship between the soundtrack and the image, to discover a new approach to acting that would involve musical space, and to achieve a radical transformation of the male-focused system of representation of mainstream cinema.” The new issue of photogénie gathers essays that further explore the oeuvres of these two filmmakers who, as <a href=\"https://cinea.be/photogenie/issues/photogenie-9-duras-rivette-irreducibilities/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Charlotte Wynant</a> writes in the introduction, “developed aesthetics that both answered the call of their time and responded to an art history that far preceded them, showing an acute sensibility to the potential and limits of their medium, which they set out to both disclose and destroy.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><ul><li>Introducing the seventh issue of <a href=\"https://maifeminism.com/issues/mai-issue-7-female-detectives/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">MAI,</a> editors Anna Backman Rogers and Anna Misiak argue that television crime drama that “centers on the female detective offers one of the few spaces within global popular culture to address some of the cardinal conjectures and concerns of feminism: agency, autonomy, professional and personal identities, sexualized male violence, misogyny, race, gendered politics, and aging.” There are essays here on Jennifer Lopez in <i>Shades of Blue</i> and Carey Mulligan in <i>Collateral,</i> but also on series from Italy and Russia. “We wish you a calm and peaceful summer,” write Backman and Misiak, “and—most of all—happy reading.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i>For news and items of interest throughout the day, every day, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criteriondaily\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">@CriterionDaily.</a></i></div>",

As <i>Screen</i>’s <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/news/wild-bunchs-cannes-slate-to-showcase-new-projects-from-dario-argento-arnold-desplechin-and-the-dardennes-exclusive/5160548.article\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Melanie Goodfellow</a> reports, European distributor Wild Bunch will bring to market one of its largest slates in years. Among the standouts is Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne’s <i>Tori and Lokita,</i> the story of two teens who have each arrived alone in Belgium from Africa; they bond over the hardships of exile. Arnaud Desplechin, whose adaptation of Philip Roth’s <i>Deception</i> will screen in the festival’s new Cannes Premiere program, is already at work on <i>Brother and Sister,</i> featuring Marion Cotillard and Melvil Poupaud as siblings in their fifties, forced by the death of their parents to deal with one another years after they have fallen out.</p><div>Wild Bunch will also arrive with Dario Argento’s <i>Dark Glasses,</i> starring Ilenia Pastorelli as a woman seeking revenge on a serial killer who has blinded her and wiped out the family of a ten-year-old boy. <i>Shining Sex</i> will gather five shorts directed by Lucile Hadžihalilović, Sion Sono, Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani, Bertrand Mandico, and Kleber Mendonça Filho. According to Goodfellow, the stories “range from a young man who falls in love with a mermaid to lovers who abandon themselves to sensual pleasure in a dance hall in Brazil.” Wild Bunch has already taken the French rights to Arnaud des Pallières’s <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/news/elle-driver-boards-period-thriller-party-of-fools-with-stellar-french-cast-exclusive/5160568.article\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Party of Fools,</i></a> which is set in nineteenth-century Paris. The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital housed an asylum for mentally ill women, many of whom were held there against their will, but Léa Seydoux will play a woman who checks in voluntarily in order to find and liberate her mother. The cast will also feature Charlotte Rampling and Cecile de France.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In other news of projects in the works, Todd Haynes—whose first documentary, <i>The Velvet Underground,</i> will premiere in Cannes out of competition—is preparing to shoot <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/natalie-portman-julianne-moore-may-december-1234994633/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>May December</i></a> next year. Natalie Portman plays a Hollywood star who travels to Maine to meet the individual her next role is based on, a woman who sparked a tabloid scandal two decades ago when she married a man who was twenty-three years her junior. She’s played by Julianne Moore, who has worked with Haynes on <i>Safe</i> (1995), <i>Far from Heaven</i> (2002), and <i>Wonderstruck</i> (2017).

It’s fun and it’s sexy and it’s shaped by the Hollywood movies that made me want to become a filmmaker.” The story of a boy who aims to get rid of his father so that he can have his mother all to himself, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Colin Farrell, who were last seen together in Yorgos Lanthimos’s <i>The Lobster</i> (2015). Lanthimos, in the meantime, is planning to shoot <a href=\"https://cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/405135/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Poor Things</i></a> later this year. It’s an adaptation of Alasdair Gray’s 1992 novel about a scientist in nineteenth-century Glasgow who saves the life of a young woman by replacing her brain with that of her unborn child. The cast is led by Emma Stone and has recently expanded to include Willem Dafoe, Mark Ruffalo, Ramy Youssef, and Jerrod Carmichael.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In other casting news, it seems that <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/taylor-swift-david-o-russell-movie-1234985875/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor Swift</a> has joined Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, John David Washington, Rami Malek, Zoe Saldana, Mike Myers, Michael Shannon, Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Rock, Andrea Riseborough, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Robert De Niro in David O.

Benning will be in attendance, and the event will be the first of three evenings launching Erika Balsom’s <a href=\"https://firefliespress.com/TEN-SKIES-Erika-Balsom\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Ten Skies,</i></a> a book on the film that both <a href=\"https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/culture/books/2021/06/30/ten-skies/162342000011828\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Adrian Martin</a> and <a href=\"https://jonathanrosenbaum.net/2021/06/ten-skies/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> call a “tour de force.” On Friday, the book’s publisher, Fireflies Press, and <a href=\"https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/fireflies-the-decadent-editions/ten-skies-five-films-by-james-benning/ten-skies-book-launch-screening/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Melbourne</a>’s ACMI (formally known as the Australian Centre for the Moving Image) will open a series of Benning’s films with a screening of <i>Ten Skies,</i> and Light Industry will present the film in <a href=\"http://lightindustry.org/tenskies\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">New York</a> on July 1.</p><div>Many of the films that Benning has made in the past twenty-plus years, such as <i>13 Lakes</i> (2004) and <i>RR</i> (2007)—a series of shots that begin with a train entering the frame and end when the train leaves it—invite the mind not only to contemplate his subjects’ subtle transformations but also, given the duration of each shot, to wander. Over the course of the ten chapters in <i>Ten Skies,</i> one for each sky, Balsom offers a possible—and richly rewarding—path. The first sky has her thinking about a sequence in Jean-Luc Godard’s <i>Passion</i> (1982), and the second has her revisiting Walter Benjamin’s 1936 essay “The Storyteller.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>It’s also in the second chapter that Balsom places <i>Ten Skies</i> within the context of Benning’s oeuvre. “From his earliest works in the 1970s, Benning has explored histories of settlement, the problem of political community, and the various ways that human actions mark the land in the United States,” she writes. “Probe his entirely sui generis filmography and you will find personal chronicles, travelogues, clever jokes, accounts of murder, indictments of whiteness, and an attention to the particularities of the Midwest. We are, in other words, a very long way from formalism. The films Benning made in the decade leading up to <i>Ten Skies</i> show a growing interest in duration and partake of an increasingly pared-down vocabulary, but alongside this formal perspicacity is an enduring commitment to political content.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>When the <a href=\"https://www.arsenal-berlin.de/en/berlinale-forum/archiv/program-archive/2005/special-screenings/ten-skies.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Berlinale Forum</a> screened <i>Ten Skies</i> in 2005, Benning said that he was thinking of “my landscape works now as anti-war artworks—they’re about the antithesis of war, the kind of beauty we’re destroying. The <i>Ten Skies</i> works came about because I’m thinking about what the opposite of war is.” From Balsom, we learn that Benning put quite a lot of work into the film, more, he tells her, than went into <i>RR.</i> Nine months were spent finding the right swath of sky at the right moment and at the right angle that would capture the full dramatic range of each sky. Many will be surprised to learn that, for his soundtrack, Benning constructed “an elaborate audio fiction” drawn from the ambient soundscapes of different environments, and sometimes, even from the soundtracks of his own previous films.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In the third chapter, which you can read in full at the <a href=\"https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/naming-the-nebulous-an-excerpt-from-ten-skies\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Notebook,</a> Balsom considers what writing—as opposed to, for example, an audiovisual essay—can reveal and illuminate about a film. <i>Ten Skies</i> is the second book in a series that Fireflies is calling <a href=\"https://firefliespress.com/Decadent-Editions\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Decadent Editions,</a> which was launched earlier this year with <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7319-march-books\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Goodbye, Dragon Inn,</i></a> Nick Pinkerton’s book on Tsai Ming-liang’s 2003 film.

The first issue paired Pier Paolo Pasolini with Apichatpong Weerasethakul, a filmmaker with whom Giovanni Marchini Camia, who cofounded Fireflies with Annabel Brady-Brown, has only become more engaged. Marchini Camia spent about two months late in 2019 on the set of <i>Memoria,</i> the first feature Apichatpong has shot outside of his native Thailand. Set in Bogotá, Colombia, Memoria stars Tilda Swinton as a Scottish woman who meets a French archaeologist overseeing a construction project.

A welcome presence with whom audiences connected immediately, the actor appeared in more than 160 films and television movies and episodes throughout his career. As word spread on Sunday that he was gone (accompanied by clips, quotes, and images), two of his performances emerged as cultural milestones.</p><div>One of those performances is Beatty’s first in a feature film. Born and raised in Kentucky, he’d been acting in theater for more than fifteen years when he landed the role of Bobby Trippe, one of four suburban business types who decide to canoe down a river winding through the wilderness of northern Georgia in <i>Deliverance</i> (1972). During an encounter deep in the woods with two mountain men, Billy is forced at gunpoint to strip and “squeal like a pig” before one of the hillbillies rapes him. “Decades later,” wrote <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/deliverance-male-rape-scene-history\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Grierson</a> in <i>Mel</i> last year, “we still cannot tolerate the image of Bobby, helpless and scared, being raped. And so, we try to nullify its impact through parodies, pop-culture references, and funny T-shirts. Turns out, though, none of that works. Watch <i>Deliverance</i> now and ‘that scene’ retains all its horror and power. The characters don’t want to talk about it, and neither do we. That’s why it still haunts all of us.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In a 1989 opinion piece for the <i>New York Times,</i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/16/opinion/suppose-men-feared-rape.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Beatty</a> noted that he couldn’t count the times he’d been told to “squeal like a pig” by complete strangers. “I suppose when someone (invariably a man) shouts this at me I am supposed to duck my head and look embarrassed at being recognized as the actor who suffered this ignominy,” he wrote. “But I feel only pride about being a part of this story, which the director John Boorman turned into a film classic. I think Bill McKinney (who portrayed the attacker) and I played the ‘rape’ scene about as well as it could be played. It was my first film, and my best.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Beatty’s Arthur Jensen, chairman of the Communications Corporation of America (CCA) in screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet’s <i>Network</i> (1976), has been the other performance most cited on social media since Sunday. Beatty appears for all of six minutes, but his delivery of an entire Weltanschauung in a single <a href=\"https://youtu.be/35DSdw7dHjs\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">monologue</a> scored him his only Oscar nomination.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In the scene, Arthur Jensen summons Howard Beale (Peter Finch), a television news anchor who has gone off script and publicly railed against one of CCA’s impending deals, into a dark and cavernous conference room. From one end of the seemingly mile-long conference table, Jenson bellows at Beale at the other. “You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples,” he thunders. “There are no nations. There are no peoples . . . There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&amp;T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.” Beatty then cuts the prophet-of-doom tone to more quietly and intimately savor the harsh truth he’s revealing. “The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has been since man crawled out of the slime.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>For <i>Variety</i>’s <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/columns/remembering-ned-beatty-network-deliverance-nashville-1234995562/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Owen Gleiberman,</a> “the beauty of Beatty’s performance is that he’s like a banker singing an aria. It’s an ecstatic piece of over-the-top acting in which Beatty seems to be making up what he’s saying on the spot, because that’s how much he <i>means</i> it.” But the Beatty performance that “means the most” to Gleiberman is his Del in Robert Altman’s <i>Nashville</i> (1975). Del is “the hustling lawyer husband of Lily Tomlin’s gospel singer, and Beatty makes him at once glad-handing and slow-moving—a get-along guy with prying sly eyes and a hunger that won’t speak its name. At home, they have two deaf children, and Del has never even bothered to learn sign language; in the scene where his kids are trying to speak to him, Beatty makes that dereliction casually heartbreaking.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>The following year, Beatty played a hit man in Elaine May’s <i>Mikey and Nicky</i> (1976). “Cinema is full of colorful hit men,” writes <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6155-mikey-and-nicky-difficult-men\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Rabin</a> in the essay that accompanies our release, “but Beatty and May upend expectations by crafting a portrayal that bears no trace of the pyrotechnics of his <i>Network</i> performance, making his gunman as unremarkable as possible. He’s just an ordinary guy with an unusual occupation, who goes about his deadly business with a grudging sense of obligation no different, really, from that of an insurance salesman eager to make his quota.” <a href=\"https://filmfreedonia.com/2021/06/15/mikey-and-nicky-1976/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Roderick Heath</a> finds that the role “deftly exploits Beatty’s excellence at playing superficially bland characters harboring hidden strata of weirdness, sharpened to a wicked point when the man’s true nature emerges in the climax.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>The <i>Guardian</i>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/14/ned-beatty-the-good-ol-boy-who-made-playing-the-ordinary-guy-look-easy\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Bradshaw</a> suggests Beatty’s performances over the following decades “accumulated into an ambiguous image: the folksy good guy or the compromised bad guy, his characters blandly accustomed to the minor privileges of power and authority that they have built up over the years. Beatty superbly put all this into one of his greatest late roles: his voiceover for the creepy Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear in Pixar’s animation <i>Toy Story 3</i> (2010), who seems like a kindly grandpa toy at the day center where Woody and the gang find themselves—but is in fact a psychopathic prison gang leader.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In an appreciation for the Chiseler, <a href=\"https://chiseler.org/post/653930519149543424/in-praise-of-ned-beatty\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Knipfel</a> nails the threat underlying Beatty’s affability. “He may have played his share of military figures, cops, political hacks, religious hucksters, office managers, and salesmen,” writes Knipfel, and “he may have been in everything from intense dramas and black comedies to superhero, horror, and family films, but at heart he’s usually the same old Ned Beatty, an amiable, easygoing schmo.” Knipfel pictures Beatty at a backyard barbecue, where he “would have no problem keeping the conversation rolling, dropping in the occasional ‘Boy, this corn sure is somethin’ special, ain’t it?’ for good measure. Of course at some point during the afternoon, after getting you alone in the garage under the pretext of seeing your new fishing rod, he’d make it perfectly clear (in those very same tones) why it would be in your own best interest as well as those of your family that you make the delivery by midnight or the deal was off. That was to be expected, though, even before you invited him over.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i>For news and items of interest throughout the day, every day, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criteriondaily\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">@CriterionDaily.</a></i></div>",

The Czech director’s debut feature tells the story of a Jewish doctor who, at the onset of the Second World War, marries a gentile in an attempt to stave off deportation to Theresienstadt, a way station to the extermination camps. Writing in Tablet about the lessons in style that Radok drew from Orson Welles’s <i>Citizen Kane</i> (1941), <a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/life-with-a-star\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">J. Hoberman</a> calls <i>Distant Journey</i> “a masterpiece of Czech cinema. It was also one of the first and remains among the strongest, most original, and most influential movies to deal with the murder of European Jewry.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><ul><li>Another new 4K restoration, Ousmane Sembène’s <i>Mandabi</i> (1968), arrives in the <a href=\"https://www.independentcinemaoffice.org.uk/films/mandabi/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">UK</a> and opens at <a href=\"https://www.bam.org/film/2021/mandabi\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">BAM Film</a> in New York today. Sembène “saw cinema as an engine of transformation, a ‘night school’ for the exploited masses of the African continent,” writes <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/where-begin-with-ousmane-sembene\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Chrystel Oloukoï</a> in a guide to the Senegalese filmmaker’s work for <i>Sight &amp; Sound.</i> For <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/reviews/mandabi-1968-ousmane-sembene-restored-wolof-masterwork\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Kaleem Aftab,</a> also writing for the magazine, <i>Mandabi,</i> Sembène’s second feature after <i>Black Girl</i> (1966), is “the film that marks out the themes of his career: his anti-capitalist, anti-religious concerns, and his clear-sighted probing of issues of class.” But it’s also, argues the <i>Guardian</i>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/09/mandabi-review-ousmane-sembene-senegal\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Bradshaw,</a> “gentle, walking-pace cinema that leads us by the hand from vignette to vignette, from scene to scene, presented to us with ingenuous simplicity and calm.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><ul><li>The first season of MUBI’s new podcast delves into the stories behind films that were huge in their home countries but little known elsewhere.

Guy Lodge goes for <i>New York, New York</i> (1977), “one of Scorsese’s greatest and gutsiest” films, while Benjamin Lee stumps for Mel Stuart’s <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i> (1971), with its storyline resembling “a chillingly casual slasher movie but for annoying children.” But Pamela Hutchinson’s case for Mervyn LeRoy’s <i>Gold Diggers of 1933</i> is hard to beat: “This is a bona fide pre-Code musical, so the talkie scenes burst with prohibition-busting backstage antics and a little Park Avenue farce, but the curtains open wide on four of the most outlandish numbers ever filmed . . . what deadpan Ned Sparks calls: ‘The gay side, the hard-boiled side, the cynical and funny side of the Depression!’” Meantime, at the <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/its-an-all-singing-all-dancing-episode-as-film-club-de-1847076214\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">A.V.

Chu’s <i>In the Heights</i> (2021) </figcaption> </figure>  \t\t<p><span class=\"dc\">F</span>andango recently <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/06/in-the-heights-fandango-poll-moviegoers-return-pandemic-1234771425/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">surveyed</a> more than 1,300 moviegoers, and ninety-six percent of them said that the first movie they plan to see now that theaters are opening up again is <i>In the Heights,</i> the big-screen version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical. Nearly every critic agrees it’s the perfect choice. The opener of <a href=\"https://www.tribecafilm.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Tribeca</a>’s twentieth-anniversary edition, the film is officially premiering today at outdoor theaters in all five boroughs of New York City. “Seeing this massive, guileless, heartfelt piece of Hollywood entertainment on the big screen is like coming home after a long year in exile only to find that it’s still there, and maybe even better than you remembered,” writes IndieWire’s <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2021/05/in-the-heights-movie-review-1234639010/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">David Ehrlich.</a></p><div>Directed by <a href=\"https://filmmakermagazine.com/111814-in-the-heights-jon-m-chu/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Jon M. Chu</a> (<i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> and two <i>Step Up</i> movies) and starring <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/movies/anthony-ramos-in-the-heights.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Ramos</a> as a Washington Heights bodega owner with big dreams, <i>In the Heights</i> is a kaleidoscopic portrait of a Latino community in flux and “an inspired swirl of hip-hop, Latin pop, salsa, and other musical idioms,” writes <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-05-21/in-the-heights-review-lin-manuel-miranda\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Chang</a> in the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i> The film’s “pleasures are often glorious, even transporting. It summons—and for the most part sustains—the kind of visual and musical energy that might help give the movies the resurgent jab-in-the-arm summer they’ve been waiting for.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>For Slate’s <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2021/05/in-the-heights-movie-review-hbo-max.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Dana Stevens,</a> “the musical numbers, with few exceptions, soar in the way an in-story song has to soar to convince us that, given this situation and these characters, ‘randomly bursting into song’ is a perfectly sensible thing to do.” In the <i>Austin Chronicle,</i> <a href=\"https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2021-06-11/in-the-heights/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Whittaker</a> spots nods to Busby Berkeley and Stanley Donen, noting that Chu “leans heavily into the inherent fantasy of the musical with massive dance routines, huge carnivals that spontaneously erupt, and fantastical elements that . . . speak to the golden era of Technicolor musicals. And, oh, is <i>In the Heights</i> vibrant and awash with color and movement.” It’s “unashamedly romantic, fearlessly thrilling, endlessly optimistic and given life and voice through sheer love of people, of place—of community.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Tribeca’s Centerpiece presentation will be the world premiere of Steven Soderbergh’s <i>No Sudden Move,</i> a crime drama set in 1954 Detroit. The cast is ridiculously enticing: Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, David Harbour, Ray Liotta, Jon Hamm, Amy Seimetz, Brendan Fraser, Kieran Culkin, Noah Jupe, Craig “muMs” Grant, Julia Fox, Frankie Shaw, and Bill Duke. The closing night movie is an as-yet-untitled Dave Chapelle documentary produced and directed by Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar (<i>American Factory</i>).</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>From today through June 20, Tribeca will host in-person talks with Guillermo del Toro, Doug Liman, M. Night Shyamalan, and Gina Prince-Bythewood as well as conversations marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of Joel and Ethan Coen’s <i>Fargo</i> and the twentieth anniversary of <i>The Royal Tenenbaums,</i> for which Wes Anderson, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Anjelica Huston, and Danny Glover will be on hand. There will be television programming, immersive experiences, video games, and podcasts, but “the bedrock of what we do,” festival director Cara Cusumano tells <i>Variety</i>’s <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/features/tribeca-film-festival-gets-back-to-the-big-screen-1234991436/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew M. Barker,</a> remains film. “Normally I would say we don’t program to themes, we just pick the best possible films,” says Cusumano. “But we did think very seriously this year about what the festival is going to mean for New York and for our audience, and we felt like it was really important to bring a program that is very uplifting and joyful. There’s a lot of comedy, there’s a lot of music.”</div> \t \t\t<figure class=\"figure-opt is-youtube-embed\"> \t\t\t<div class=\"video-contain\"> \t\t\t\t<div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper embed-responsive\"> \t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/u5pTICZ2oeg?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" name=\"fitvid0\"></iframe> \t\t\t\t<div class=\"ovl\"></div></div> \t\t\t</div> \t\t\t \t\t</figure> \t \t\t<p>For recommendations, you might turn to <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2021/06/tribeca-2021-most-anticipated-films-events-1234642006/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">IndieWire,</a> the <a href=\"https://theplaylist.net/2021-tribeca-film-festival-preview-15-must-see-films-20210607/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Playlist,</a> <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2021/06/tribeca-festival-2021-17-movies-to-see.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Vulture,</a> or <a href=\"https://womenandhollywood.com/tribeca-2021-preview-sisters-racing-their-way-into-history-nigerians-fighting-for-lgbtq-rights-more/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Women and Hollywood</a>—or to <a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/06/08/tribeca-21-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-all-together-in-the-dark/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Atkinson,</a> who has been writing semi-regularly again for the <i>Village Voice.</i> The granddaddy of alternative weeklies <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5900-the-village-voice-ends-its-sixty-three-year-run\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">ceased</a> editorial production nearly three years ago, but since January, new articles have been appearing at the site, and in April, stacks of the first print edition since September 2017 were suddenly all over the city.

Julie strikes up an ill-defined relationship with Anthony (Tom Burke), an endearingly smug older man who turns out to be a heroin addict. As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/movies/the-souvenir-review.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">A. O. Scott</a> pointed out in the <i>New York Times,</i> the plot—stripped of Hogg’s assured compositions and the striking performances by Byrne, Burke, Tilda Swinton as Julie’s mother, and a small but crucial turn from Richard Ayoade—may seem “absorbing but also conventional: another chronicle of addiction and codependency, another cautionary fable of a smart woman making a foolish choice, another period drama celebrating a wilder time. It sort of <i>is</i> all of that, but it is also emphatically <i>not</i> that at all.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In November 2019, Hogg told <a href=\"https://thefilmstage.com/joanna-hogg-on-the-souvenir-part-ii-resisting-nostalgia-and-losing-robert-pattinson/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Rory O’Connor</a> at the Film Stage that she was already editing <i>Part II,</i> whose story takes off immediately where the first film left off and through “almost to the end of the ’80s. And it’s focusing very much on Julie again.” She’s still at film school, and <i>Part II</i> is very much about “how her life experience is fused with her creativity.” Robert Pattinson was to set to take a leading role, but when he had to back out due to scheduling conflicts, Hogg split his character in two and cast Harris Dickinson (<i>Beach Rats</i>) and Charlie Heaton (<i>Stranger Things</i>).</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Another highlight in this year’s Directors’ Fortnight lineup is <i>Ali &amp; Ava,</i> a love story from another outstanding British director, Clio Barnard (<i>The Arbor,</i> <i>The Selfish Giant</i>). Adeel Akhtar (<i>Four Lions</i>) and Claire Rushbrook (<i>Secrets &amp; Lies</i>) star as a landlord and a teacher brought together by a young girl. Jonas Carpignano (<i>Mediterranea,</i> <i>A Ciambra</i>) will bring <i>A Chiara,</i> the story of a teenager investigating the disappearance of her father. <i>Întregalde,</i> the seventh feature from Radu Muntean (<i>The Paper Will Be Blue;</i> <i>Tuesday, After Christmas</i>), promises to be a suspenseful tale tracking three humanitarians journeying through Romania’s Apuseni Mountains.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Films by multiple directors are scattered throughout the lineup. Alice Rohrwacher (<i>Happy as Lazzaro</i>), Pietro Marcello (<i>Martin Eden</i>), and Francesco Munzi (<i>Black Souls</i>) have teamed up on <i>Futura,</i> a documentary about how young Italians see the future. Miguel Gomes (<i>Arabian Nights</i>) and French documentarian Maureen Fazendeiro collaborated on <i>Tsugua Diaries,</i> which was shot on 16 mm. They describe their project as “a lockdown journal” but “also a fiction.” Lois Patiño (<i>Red Moon Tide</i>) and Matías Piñeiro (<i>Isabella</i>) have made a short film together, <i>Sycorax,</i> which is based on Shakespeare’s <i>The Tempest,</i>&nbsp; and they’re already working on a feature, <i>Ariel.</i> Another highlight from the shorts program is Peter Tscherkassky’s <i>Train Again,</i> an homage to fellow Austrian filmmaker Kurt Kren that <a href=\"https://www.sixpackfilm.com/en/catalogue/2688/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Stefan Grissemann</a> describes as “a phantom ride through the engine room of the seventh art, a ceremony of the (violent) mechanics of railway vehicles and image transporters.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>This year’s edition will open with Emmanuel Carrère’s <i>Between Two Worlds,</i> starring Juliette Binoche as a writer who takes a job as a cleaning lady while she researches her next book. When the coworkers she’s befriended find out who she really is, things do not go smoothly. Rachel Lang’s <i>Our Men,</i> which centers on the friendship between two military wives in Corsica, will close out the festival.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>We should mention that the French Association for the Distribution of Independent Film (<a href=\"https://www.lacid.org/fr/magazine/l-acid-devoile-sa-programmation-acid-cannes-2021-2781\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">ACID</a>) also unveiled a lineup this morning. The twenty-ninth edition, running parallel to Cannes, <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7413-critics-week-2021-lineup\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Critics’ Week,</a> and the Directors’ Fortnight, will present five works of fiction and four documentaries, all of them currently seeking distribution.

The careers of Arnaud Desplechin, Nadav Lapid, Julia Ducournau, Justin Kurzel, Hafsia Herzi, and François Ozon have also been launched by the program, which is run by the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics. This year’s edition will open on July 7 with <i>Robust,</i> the first feature from Constance Meyer, who has won several awards over the past few years for her short films. <i>Robust</i> centers on the relationship between an aging movie star (Gérard Depardieu) and his new assistant, played by Déborah Lukumuena, the breakthrough star of Houda Benyamina’s <i>Divines</i> (2016). Leyla Bouzid’s <i>A Tale of Love and Desire,</i> the story of an eighteen-year-old French-Algerian who falls for a young Tunisian immigrant, will wrap Critics’ Week 2021 on July 15.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Other special screenings include <i>A Radiant Girl,</i> the first feature directed by renowned actor and singer Sandrine Kiberlain, and Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet’s <a href=\"https://www.semainedelacritique.com/en/news/la-semaine-de-la-critique-reveals-its-60thanniversary-film\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Anaïs in Love,</i></a> selected specifically to celebrate the program’s sixtieth anniversary. The film sets up a love triangle between characters played by Denis Podalydès, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, and Anaïs Demoustier, who, the programmers promise, “is more sensuous, liberated, and vibrant than ever, and whose playful energy is bewitching.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Seven more first features will compete for three awards, and Romanian director <a href=\"https://www.semainedelacritique.com/en/news/romanian-director-cristian-mungiu-president-of-the-60thedition-of-la-semaine-de-la-critique\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Cristian Mungiu,</a> who won the Palme d’Or in 2007 for <i>4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,</i> will preside over the jury.

Minh-ha’s <i>Surname Viet Given Name</i> Nam (1989), Victor Guimarães on Brazilian cinema, Giovanni Vimercati on the late Cecilia Mangini, Devika Girish’s interview with Jia Zhangke, and Ashley Clark’s conversation with Matt Wolf about <i>Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell</i> (2008).

Twenty-four films will compete for the Palme d’Or, eighteen will premiere in the Un Certain Regard program, six will screen out of competition. There will also be a round of special screenings, a midnight title, and a whole new program. Cannes Première will present ten new works from directors who have had films in competition in the past, “which means,” Frémaux tells IndieWire’s <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2021/06/cannes-2021-thierry-fremaux-interview-lineup-1234641420/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Kohn,</a> “they’ll be there without any backlash or questions about their stature.”</p><div>Frémaux and festival president Pierre Lescure promise yet more to come. We’ll soon be hearing about the closing night film and a big-budget crowd-pleaser set for a premiere on the beach, and next week, the names of the jury members serving with president Spike Lee will be revealed.

That may or may not account for some of the missing names many were expecting to hear on Thursday, filmmakers who are believed to have projects at the ready: Claire Denis, for example, or Terence Davies, Joanna Hogg, Joel Coen, Jane Campion, Park Chan-wook, Terrence Malick, Lucile Hadžihalilović, and maybe even Paul Thomas Anderson.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><div><b>Competition</b></div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Leos Carax’s <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7364-carax-and-sparks-will-open-cannes-2021\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Annette,</i></a> the opening night film starring Adam Driver, Marion Cotillard, and Simon Helberg and featuring musical numbers by Sparks, is one of seven French films lined up for this year’s competition. <i>France</i> is the actual title of Bruno Dumont’s eleventh feature, with Léa Seydoux as a journalist whose life is upended by a car accident. The title of Jacques Audiard’s story of friends and lovers zeroes in on <i>Paris, 13th District.</i> In François Ozon’s <i>Everything Went Fine,</i> André Dussollier plays an eighty-five-year-old who asks his daughter (Sophie Marceau) to help him die.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Three of the four women with films in the competition are French. <i>Titane,</i> featuring Vincent Lindon, is Julia Ducournau’s long-awaited follow-up to <i>Raw</i> (2016). Mia Hansen-Løve’s <i>Bergman Island,</i> the story of a pair of American filmmakers working on projects on the Swedish island of Fårö, where Ingmar Bergman lived and worked for decades, stars Mia Wasikowska, Vicky Krieps, and Tim Roth. And demonstrators besiege a hospital in Catherine Corsini’s <i>La fracture.</i></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>The fourth female director is Ildikó Enyedi, who won the Camera d’Or in Cannes in 1989 for <i>My Twentieth Century.</i> In <i>The Story of My Wife,</i> a sea captain (Gijs Naber) bets a friend in a café that he’ll marry the first woman who walks in. That woman is Lizzy, played by Léa Seydoux, whose <i>third</i> film in the competition is <i>The French Dispatch.</i> Wes Anderson tells three stories from the final issue of an American magazine set in a fictional city in France, and besides Seydoux, the cast features Benicio del Toro, Adrien Brody, Frances McDormand, Timothée Chalamet, Jeffrey Wright, Mathieu Amalric, Stephen Park, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Tilda Swinton. Swinton will also appear in Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s <i>Memoria</i> as a Scottish woman traveling in Colombia, where she begins seeing and hearing things that have her questioning her own identity.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>As with <i>The French Dispatch,</i> the inclusion of Paul Verhoeven’s <i>Benedetta,</i> based on Judith C. Brown’s 1986 book about a lesbian abbess in Renaissance Italy, is no surprise. But Sean Baker’s <i>Red Rocket</i> is. Secretly shot last fall, <i>Red Rocket</i> is a dark comedy about a pimp going on forty who leaves Los Angeles for his hometown in Texas to start anew—until he meets a woman in a donut shop named Strawberry.

In the run-up to Friday’s release, contributors to In Review Online are revisiting every feature as well as a “smattering” of television films and episodes Petzold has directed over the course of twenty-five years. The German filmmaker is “arguably contemporary cinema’s most consistent chronicler of twenty-first-century Europe, an era formed and defined by the economic, political, and social calamities of the preceding twentieth century,” writes <a href=\"https://inreviewonline.com/2021/05/28/christian-petzold-retro/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Gorman</a> in the introduction to the InRO retrospective. “It’s a fascinating body of work, with cold, sparse surfaces that contain a surfeit of explosive emotions—indeed, Petzold might be our last true purveyor of the melodrama.”</p><div>The centuries-old story of a water nymph who takes on human form and a lover who must never leave her—if he does, she’ll have to kill him and return to the water—is fertile ground for melodrama. Beer’s Undine is dumped in the very first scene, but before she has time to process the pain, she falls for Christoph, an underwater welder played by one of Germany’s rising stars, Franz Rogowski, who, like Beer, first worked with Petzold on <i>Transit</i> (2018).</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Beer’s vague resemblance to Nina Hoss, the star of Petzold’s <i>Something to Remind Me</i> (2001), <i>Wolfsburg</i> (2003), <i>Yella</i> (2007), <i>Jerichow</i> (2008), <i>Barbara</i> (2012), and <i>Phoenix</i> (2014), has drawn unfavorable comparisons from a handful of critics. In the Notebook, <a href=\"https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/berlinale-2020-christian-petzold-s-fairy-tale-berlin\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Kasman</a> finds that Beer “fails to have that magical something” that has given Hoss “an entrancingly independent and unpredictable singularity.” <a href=\"http://4columns.org/anderson-melissa/undine\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Anderson</a> has had her reservations as well. “Besotted with Hoss, I took an irrational dislike to Beer, whom I found a wan substitute: too young, too short, incapable of ever exuding Hoss’s casual steeliness, her throaty grandeur,” she writes in 4Columns. But Anderson has come around. “<i>Undine</i>’s success owes largely to Beer’s talent for seamlessly inhabiting two personas—one rooted in the outré, the other in centuries of certainties and data—often at the same time.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Undine works as a guide to a museum’s collection of three-dimensional models of Berlin depicting the city in various stages of its turbulent development: from a sooty industrial town in the nineteenth century to the capital of a fascist regime in the twentieth, then from the crushed site of loss and rubble to the focal point of the Cold War, and most recently, a hub of real estate speculation and gentrification. “I think of Berlin as a raped city architecturally,” Petzold tells <a href=\"https://screenanarchy.com/2021/06/interview-christian-petzold-on-undine.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Dustin Chang</a> at ScreenAnarchy. “Every three years, someone is coming with new architecture plans.” When the wall dividing the city fell in 1989, “Berlin had the chance,” says Petzold. “We had a whole city being united, which was now in the hands of the government. It was not a private property. It was our property. We could’ve made something beautiful.” So “someone like Undine who’s been living here for centuries, with all these changes, she is like a sad witness of our changing times. So this was our idea.”</div> \t \t\t<figure class=\"figure-opt is-youtube-embed\"> \t\t\t<div class=\"video-contain\"> \t\t\t\t<div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper embed-responsive\"> \t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HD0ABeBzx3U?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" name=\"fitvid0\"></iframe> \t\t\t\t<div class=\"ovl\"></div></div> \t\t\t</div> \t\t\t \t\t</figure> \t \t\t<p>Reviewing <i>Undine</i> for <i>Sight &amp; Sound,</i> <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/reviews/undine-christian-petzold-berlin-love-story-water-nymph-myth\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Giovanni Marchini Camia</a> observes that “the notion of imperfect regeneration emerges both as a structuring principle, in the narrative’s many doublings and déjà vus, and a recurring motif: in the keepsake diver figurine that Undine breaks and glues back together; in Christoph’s job as an industrial diver, welding a dam’s damaged underwater turbines; in the cycle of destruction and reconstruction that defines the history of Berlin.”</p><div>As <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2021/05/30/undine-retold/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">J. Hoberman</a> writes in the <i>New York Review of Books,</i> <i>Undine</i> eventually “plunges decisively into the supernatural, with accidents, acts of vengeance, vanishings, and intimations of <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>” Back in <i>Sight &amp; Sound,</i> <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/reviews/undine-2020-christian-petzold-berlin-fairytale-romance-diver-water-nymph\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Romney</a> suggests that Petzold “teasingly invites us to accept the drama as being situated between realism and fairy tale, in a zone of narrative logic akin to dream. It’s no accident that at different points Christoph and Undine doze off in broad daylight; and Petzold has claimed the eminently oneiric <i>Vertigo</i> as one of the film’s inspirations.” For Newcity Film’s <a href=\"https://www.newcityfilm.com/2021/06/02/water-worlds-christian-petzold-surfaces-undine/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Pride,</a> “Petzold has grown into the role of a master of the cumulative power of elegant drama—the layers of fantasy these characters create for themselves are epic but tangible—but also of the smashing payoff.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Undine is the first in a projected trilogy of films that will transpose myths rooted in the elements to contemporary settings. He tells Dustin Chang that, after spending a week in bed with Covid last year, he ditched the dystopian screenplay he’d completed. “I’m not interested in dystopia anymore,” he says. Bed-ridden, he watched his way through an Eric Rohmer box set. “I was so impressed by Rohmer’s films, so I started writing a new story, and I am now finished with the script,” he says. In this Rohmer-inspired story, a group of young people spend the summer by the Baltic Sea. The forest catches fire, “and their desire and their hearts are also burning, and the fire in the end is out of control.” <a href=\"https://thefilmstage.com/paula-beer-on-christian-petzolds-methodical-approach-and-telling-a-berlin-fairytale-with-undine/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Paula Beer</a> will star.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i>For news and items of interest throughout the day, every day, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criteriondaily\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">@CriterionDaily.</a></i></div>",

Written by Wilder, based on a story by Curt Siodmak, shot by Eugen Schüfftan, and directed by Robert Siodmak and Edgar G. Ulmer, this “lackadaisical neorealist portrait of a quartet of carefree German youth on a day off, swimming and sunbathing, flirting and quarreling, was a smack in the face to the artsy pretensions of mainstream German cinema,” writes Doherty. “Everyone chips in regardless of job description (Wilder schlepped the camera equipment and held the light reflectors), all in the service of ‘shooting a few truths we consider important, for a laughably small sum of money.’ Wilder relates the backstory with utter sincerity and boyish exuberance, without a trace of cynicism.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/billy-wilder/9780231201469\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Billy Wilder: Dancing on the Edge,</i></a> a critical study by Joseph McBride, the author of books on Orson Welles, John Ford, and Ernst Lubitsch, will be out in October.

On September 11 of the following year (not quite three years into the Allende administration), the military staged a coup d’état, ending a four-decade-long succession of democratically elected governments in Chile and establishing a junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet.</p><div>The coup left Ruiz little choice but to abandon <i>Socialist Realism</i> and flee Chile for France with his wife and close collaborator, filmmaker Valeria Sarmiento. Much of the unedited material eventually wound up being stored at Duke University in North Carolina. Now, Sarmiento, working with the Chilean production company Poetastros, has launched an international campaign to complete what <a href=\"https://www.latercera.com/culto/2021/05/28/al-rescate-de-la-ultima-pelicula-de-raul-ruiz/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Gonzalo Valdivia,</a> writing for the Chilean daily <i>La Tercera,</i> calls one of Ruiz’s most ambitious and political works.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>When Ruiz died in 2011, he had made well over a hundred films and was preparing to shoot <i>Lines of Wellington,</i> an epic war movie with a cast led by John Malkovich and including Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, and Michel Piccoli. Sarmiento took the reins, and <i>Lines of Wellington</i> premiered in competition in Venice before screening at the Toronto and New York film festivals. She then turned to three projects that Ruiz had begun in Chile but had never been able to complete. In 1990, when the Pinochet regime finally fell, Ruiz returned to conduct an acting workshop that led to the creation of <i>A Wandering Soap Opera,</i> a formally rambunctious tribute to the telenovela. Sarmiento shaped the material into an eighty-minute feature that she presented in 2017 in Locarno, where Ruiz’s debut feature, <i>Three Sad Tigers,</i> had won the Golden Leopard back in 1969.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Two years before that auspicious debut, Ruiz, then just twenty-seven, wrote and directed <i>The Tango of the Widower</i> but couldn’t raise the funds for the sound design. Half a century later, Sarmiento oversaw the restoration of the black-and-white footage and created a new audio track. In February 2020, <i>The Tango of the Widower and Its Distorting Mirror,</i> which centers on a professor haunted by visions of his late wife, opened the Berlinale’s Forum program and is now slated to screen in New York in July and August as part of Film at Lincoln Center’s <a href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/daily/big-screen-summer-celebrating-the-return-of-cinemas-with-nyff58-redux-from-june-11-august-26/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Big Screen Summer</a> program. “Perhaps the best way to think of <i>The Tango of the Widower</i> is as a reincarnation,” suggests <a href=\"https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/tango-widower-distorting-mirror-raul-ruiz-valeria-sarmiento-dadaist-widower-professor\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ela Bittencourt</a> in <i>Sight &amp; Sound.</i> “Though nominally ‘co-directed,’ its process is more like a creative interference—in the best sense of the word—with an archeological find.”</span></div> \t \t\t<figure class=\"figure-opt is-youtube-embed\"> \t\t\t<div class=\"video-contain\"> \t\t\t\t<div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper embed-responsive\"> \t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/532598695\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" name=\"fitvid0\"></iframe> \t\t\t\t<div class=\"ovl\"></div></div> \t\t\t</div> \t\t\t \t\t</figure> \t \t\t<p>In <i>Socialist Realism,</i> a factory worker is accused of stealing tools, while off in a smoke-filled room, intellectuals debate the future of Popular Unity. “At a certain moment,” Ruiz once wrote, “these characters intersect in an apparent friendship that ends in action-packed scenes with crossing bullets and songs shouted at the top of their lungs, thus producing a satirical reading of the time.” A fifty-minute rough cut of <i>Socialist Realism,</i> a mere sketch, made the rounds some years ago, but Gonzalo Valdivia reports that Ruiz envisioned a final version that would run somewhere between 150 and 225 minutes.</p><div>Sarmiento and Poetastros, reteaming with <i>Tango</i> editor Galut Alarcón and composer Jorge Arriagada, are looking to raise around $150,000 to complete <i>Socialist Realism</i> fifty years after Ruiz shot it. They have applied for four separate grants from Chile’s Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Heritage, and have been rejected each time. They’re now turning to the international community of cinephiles for support. “Ruiz’s oeuvre is one of the most sprawling, singular, and influential bodies of work in all of world cinema,” writes Dennis Lim at the <a href=\"https://www.ruizsarmiento.film/en/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">campaign site,</a> “and the possibility of that body expanding to include the films that the hyper-prolific Ruiz himself was unable to complete during his lifetime is not just immensely exciting, it is a fundamentally Ruizian enterprise.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i>For news and items of interest throughout the day, every day, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criteriondaily\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">@CriterionDaily.</a></i></div>",

The dreamy slow-motion pillow fight in the students’ dormitory, the movie’s most famous set piece, is a utopian affirmation of possibilities beyond the parameters of a repressive institution.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><ul><li>Writing for <i>Artforum</i> five years ago, <a href=\"https://www.artforum.com/film/nick-pinkerton-on-her-man-a-forgotten-masterwork-in-context-at-moma-59046\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Pinkerton</a> suggested that if one were to “devise the platonic ideal of a pre-Code movie it would probably look quite a bit like Tay Garnett’s 1930 barrelhouse melodrama <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/film/5303\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Her Man.</i></a>” It’s a retelling of the story of doomed lovers Frankie and Johnnie starring Helen Twelvetrees and Ricardo Cortez and set in a Havana dive.

Hoberman</a> in the <i>New York Times,</i> “but what really sets Her Man apart is its fluidity.

Divided into eighteen chapters, <i>Swimming</i> draws on conversations with those who remember the late writer Ma Feng, best known for the stories he wrote in the 1950s and ’60s, and with three living writers, Jia Pingwa, Yu Hua, and Liang Hong. As <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/the-great-director-jia-zhangke-profiles-literary-heroes-1846973693\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ignatiy Vishnevetsky</a> points out at the A.V. Club, “what emerges is a fragmentary oral history of Chinese rural life across several transformative decades of the twentieth century.” Jia tells Cronk that what too often goes missing in “abstract or statistical histories” is “not necessarily what happened, but <i>how</i> things happened, and those are the details which I hope, once seen, will offer compelling evidence as to why we and other documentary filmmakers make the films we make.” Talking to <a href=\"https://filmmakermagazine.com/111736-the-past-inside-the-present-jia-zhangke-on-swimming-out-till-the-sea-turns-blue/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Forrest Cardamenis</a> at <i>Filmmaker,</i> Jia says that he wants his audience “to listen again and really face what we have experienced so that we will not make the same mistakes again.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><ul><li>Making the same mistakes again and again is a running motif throughout <a href=\"https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/on-body-and-soul-sergei-loznitsa-discusses-state-funeral\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Hugo Emmerzael</a>’s engaging interview in the Notebook with Sergei Loznitsa, the director of such fictional features as <i>My Joy</i> (2010) and <i>Donbass</i> (2018) as well as several documentaries, including <i>Austerlitz</i> (2016), <i>The Trial</i> (2018), and <i>State Funeral</i> (2019). “The most prescient mention of crowds in literature was made by Alexander Pushkin in <i>Boris Godunov,</i>” says Loznitsa, referencing the play that Modest Mussorgsky turned into an opera, which in turn, was adapted for the screen in 1954 by Vera Stroyeva and in 1989 by Andrzej Żuławski. “There has been this tragic situation that involves the killing of a child. The finale depicts a large crowd that witnesses this horrific event happening on stage. In the last sentence Pushkin remarks that people are speechless. ‘The People are silent with horror.’ Starting from this remark, I think we can have a perspective on various events throughout Soviet history.”</li></ul></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i>For news and items of interest throughout the day, every day, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criteriondaily\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">@CriterionDaily.</a></i></div>",

Several months later, it screened at the New York Film Festival, and then returned to the States in 2012 for a one-off screening at Japan Society, but it’s never seen a proper theatrical release in the U.S. Now New York’s Metrograph is screening <i>Tale of Cinema,</i> albeit virtually, through Monday.</p><div>It’s a tale told in two distinct parts. In the first, Sang-won, a young student played by Lee Ki-woo, bumps into an ex-girlfriend, Young-shil (Uhm Ji-won), and after dinner and sex, they decide to kill themselves—together. Following a transition so smooth that it takes many viewers a moment or two to realize it’s happened, Dong-soo (Kim Sang-kyung), recently graduated from film school, walks out of the theater that’s just screened this story of suicidal lovers, a film that not only uncomfortably echoes a chapter in Dong-soo’s own life and stars an actress named Young-shil but has also been made by his mentor, Yi Hyongsu, an ailing director of some renown.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In her 2005 review for Reverse Shot, <a href=\"http://www.reverseshot.org/reviews/entry/700/tale_cinema\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Kristi Mitsuda</a> raised a series of questions. “Did we witness Yi Hyongsu’s empirical version of the movie or Dong-soo’s mental interpretation? Or did we, in fact, see it as Dong-soo would have directed it?” And further: “Did Hong cut away from the embedded piece at an arbitrary point? What does it mean that he chose to shoot both the ‘fictional’ and ‘real’ segments in near-identical styles, replete with conspicuous zooms and without any marked differences to distinguish his own film from that of Yi Hyongsu’s?”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>For Slant’s <a href=\"https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/a-tale-of-cinema/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ed Gonzalez,</a> also writing in 2005, <i>Tale of Cinema</i> “isn’t just some ordinary tale about art imitating life and vice versa; given the structure of the film and overlapping details, it’s easy and tempting to read it as such, except the film-within-a-film doesn’t provoke Dong-soo to imitate its story as much as it opens the floodgates of memory. Hong recognizes the power of cinema to connect us to our personal experiences, but in the way Dong-soo sadly projects his feelings for a long-ago flame onto Young-shil, he also acknowledges its deluding strength.”</div> \t \t\t<figure class=\"figure-opt is-youtube-embed\"> \t\t\t<div class=\"video-contain\"> \t\t\t\t<div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper embed-responsive\"> \t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/BtREmJ8nLp0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" name=\"fitvid0\"></iframe> \t\t\t\t<div class=\"ovl\"></div></div> \t\t\t</div> \t\t\t \t\t</figure> \t \t\t<p>In the <i>New Yorker,</i> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/tale-of-cinema-reviewed-a-crucial-hong-sang-soo-film-finally-reaches-theatres\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Brody</a> places <i>Tale of Cinema</i> within the context of Hong’s busy career, and writes that his “ramped-up manipulations of time and continuity, fusions of reality and fantasy, and speculative dramatization of alternate worlds show a cinematized mind at work in real time. When a great filmmaker titles a movie <i>Tale of Cinema,</i> it’s a red flag to herald matters of great personal implication. With its immediate drama and its far-reaching vision of untapped possibilities, this movie fulfills that promise.”</p><div><i>For news and items of interest throughout the day, every day, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criteriondaily\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">@CriterionDaily.</a></i></div>",

These online screenings are free in the U.S., Canada, and Palestine, but capacity is limited. “On the one hand,” wrote <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6395-a-leading-palestinian-auteur-looks-toward-the-light\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Bilge Ebiri,</a> introducing his interview with the director published on the Current two years ago, Suleiman’s films “are droll, deadpan comedies that at times recall the films of Charlie Chaplin and Jacques Tati, with Suleiman himself often at the center as a quiet, bemused, occasionally melancholy protagonist and observer. But the absurdities in these pictures come from somewhere deadly serious: the surreal texture of life in Palestine under Israeli occupation.”</p><div>Suleiman grew up poor in Nazareth, often referred to as “the Arab capital of Israel,” and left the city for New York in his early twenties. In 1994, he moved to Jerusalem and began teaching at Birzeit University in the West Bank and working on <i>Chronicle of a Disappearance</i> (1996), which won an award for best first feature in Venice. In <i>Chronicle,</i> Suleiman “presents a series of tableaux, seemingly unconnected images and incidents that give the impression that they are searching for a unifying narrative thread,” wrote <a href=\"https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1997-11-21/chronicle-of-a-disappearance/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Marjorie Baumgarten</a> in the <i>Austin Chronicle</i> the following year. “Despite their idiopathic expressiveness, no conventional storyline emerges. But together they create a compelling portrait of marginalization and inaction.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Writing for <i>Artforum,</i> <a href=\"https://www.artforum.com/print/199706/elia-suleiman-s-chronicle-of-a-disappearance-32785\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Indiana</a> suggested that <i>Chronicle</i> “would probably look like a post-Godardian exercise in minimalist cinema if its pieces weren’t charged by their setting. Suleiman ponders his identity as a Palestinian; Palestine searches for itself inside a political-military-socioeconomic organism called Israel. Life goes on, but in conditions of nervous uncertainty about the future. The quality of nothing-happening is a freighted sense of something in abeyance, a feeling of fragility about all arrangements and expectations.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i>Divine Intervention</i> (2002) premiered in Cannes, won a jury award, and was named the best film in competition by the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI). Set in Nazareth, <i>Divine</i> has a “sketch comedy structure” that is “less an evocation of Israeli aggression than it is a startling acknowledgement of a society’s chilling acclimation to day-to-day terror,” wrote Slant’s <a href=\"https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/divine-intervention/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ed Gonzalez.</a> “Perhaps more incredible than the film’s daring structure is the smoothness of the execution—like sharp, many-ridged blade.” <i>The Time That Remains</i> (2008) is “a funny, achingly sad, and discreetly bitter bricolage of embellished autobiography that evolves into a counter-history of the State of Israel, from 1948 onward,” wrote <a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/01/05/elia-suleimans-arab-israeli-war-within/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ella Taylor</a> at the top of her interview with Suleiman for the <i>Village Voice</i> in 2011. “In its oblique, intensely personal way, <i>The Time That Remains</i> inserts an acidic voice into the fierce debates currently being waged in the country about who qualifies as Israeli.”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In 2019, Suleiman returned to Cannes for a third time, winning a special mention from the jury and another FIPRESCI prize for <i>It Must Be Heaven.</i> Here, Suleiman “turns his delightfully absurdist, unfailingly generous gaze beyond the physical homeland, where parallels and dissonance abound,” wrote <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/it-must-be-heaven-review-1203225342/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Weissberg</a> for <i>Variety.</i> He leaves Nazareth for Paris, and then New York, only to find that no matter how far he roams, the world remains just off-kilter enough to keep reminding him of home. Weissberg observes that “Suleiman’s robe of bemusement protects a more fragile body both at home and abroad, where the possibility of exile adds a further level of destabilization: What does it mean to carry one’s roots to a different soil?”</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i>For news and items of interest throughout the day, every day, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criteriondaily\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">@CriterionDaily.</a></i></div>",

If the former—“essentially a gay-tinted buddy movie exploiting the gorgeous squalor of late-1960s Times Square,” as Oleszczyk puts it—hadn’t won three Oscars, the latter might never have been made. “<i>Sunday Bloody Sunday</i> was the film that not only helped shape my notion of what a gay life may have in store for me—more profoundly, it also formed my idea of adulthood itself, as a state of constant flux, imperfect decisions, and pursuit of elusive satisfaction,” says Oleszczyk.
