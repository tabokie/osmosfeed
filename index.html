 graduated and got busy with life, and we lost touch.

                <p>Tail Latency Might Matter More Than You Think
A frustratingly qualitative approach.
Tail latency, also known as high-percentile latency, refers to high latencies that clients see fairly infrequently. Things like: "my service mostly responds in around 10ms, but sometimes takes around 100ms". There are many causes of tail latency in the world, including contention, garbage collection, packet loss, host failure, and weird stuff operating systems do in the background. It's tempting to look at the 99.9th percent…</p>

                <p>How I Implemented /dev/printerfact in Rust
Kernel mode programming is a frightful endeavor. One of the big problems with it
is that C is really your only option on Linux. C has many historical problems
with it that can't really be fixed at this point without radically changing the
language to the point that existing code written in C would be incompatible with
it.

                <p>Redundant against what?
Threat modeling thinking to distributed systems.
There's basically one fundamental reason that distributed systems can achieve better availability than single-box systems: redundancy. The software, state, and other things needed to run a system are present in multiple places. When one of those places fails, the others can take over. This applies to replicated databases, load-balanced stateless systems, serverless systems, and almost all other common distributed patterns.
