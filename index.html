                    <span>人有自由意志吗？今天听刚哥 说Robert Sapolsky 的书 Behave。书中说到：


1980 年代，神经生理学家本杰明·李贝特（Benjamin Libet）做了一个被传诵至今的经典实验。实验中受试者要做一个简单的动作，比如选择打开还是关上一个开关。科学家使用核磁共振同时观察大脑的活动，发现在受试者意识到自己选择怎么做的几百毫秒甚至几秒之前，他的大脑其实已经做出了选择。

这个实验似乎证明了人没有自由意志，你的意识只是听大脑的。但是萨波斯基介绍，李贝特本人对这个现象有个更高级的说法。李贝特说，是，你没有决定往哪边按下开关的自由意志 —— 但是，当你的大脑已经做出选择之后，到你切实按下开关之前的那半秒钟之内，你的意识可以决定不按那个开关。你有最后一刻的否决权。

对我来说这是非常惊人的知识，这叫“自由非意志（Free Won&#x27;t）”。这是一个充满争议的解释，有很多实验研究，有的同意有的反对。

但不论如何，我们姑且认为人真的有否决权，那我们要问的是，这个否决权，又是啥东西呢？那个否决权只可能是生物因素，而你不能说因为现在脑神经科学家还没有达成共识，所以人还是有自由意志的。萨波斯基承认，脑神经科学仍然在发展之中 …</span>

《最后的咒语》是一款兼具回合制战棋、基地建设和Roguelite随机元素的策略RPG游戏。玩家需要通过塔防、战棋等形式守护基地内的法师，让其完成“最后的咒语”，给早已灭亡的世界创造出最后的希望。



无法避免的高门槛
《最后的咒语》是一款典型上来就把难度拉满的游戏。首次进入游戏时，游戏几乎只提供给玩家1%的内容（真的只有1%），而敌人则是全副武装。在撑过第一个夜晚后你可能还心有余力，但要不了多久你就会发现敌我数量差距、强度差距不是简单的操作可以弥补的。


实际上在解锁到一定量的内容以前，游戏是绝对无法通关的，但这并非是制作组特意拉长游戏时间，实际上“需要不断走死胡同”来解锁奖励的方式是游戏模式的必然。
本作目前只有一个大关卡，玩家需要在这座世界上最后的城镇内给房屋添砖加瓦、给英雄招兵买马，并在不断增强的敌人围攻下坚持12个夜晚。通常情况下每次完整的游戏都在6~8小时左右，这在Roguelite游戏中也是极为少见的长，因此游戏采用了“前期必不可能过”的形式来压缩早期摸门路时的每局时间。通常来说前3局游戏的游玩都是以解锁奖励为目的，这个过程可能会花费10小时左右——你会在筋疲力尽中死去，但你的死亡不断增强了成功的可能。


《最后的咒语》提供了两种方式解锁更多内容，一种是通过每关杀怪掉落的“污秽精华”主动解锁黑暗女神的奖励，另一种则需要在游玩过程中达成某个成就来解锁光明女神的奖励。目前两者解锁内容共计136种，并且许多解锁项都能极大的提高玩家强度，例如简单粗暴的增加每个英雄的行动点，或是解锁更多武器技能，都造就了本作越玩越简单的特点。


但游戏的前期与其说难度高，不如说需要一个正确的游玩方向。在早期十分推荐先打开简单模式的所有选项，撑到第五个夜晚结束后，便能解锁酒馆建筑来招募更多的英雄，至此才给攻关提供了可能。

                    <span>As a design feature, cantilevers can exist for any number of reasons, as rational results of form-making, impressive feats of engineering, or just unnecessary spectacles. Either way, they often result in buildings that appear both heavy and light at the same time and they present safely precarious situations for their inhabitants. The video describes what cantilevers are as well as some of the structural principles which govern their design like tension, compression, moment, and shear. It also goes over some great examples by architects like MVRDV, Rem Koolhaas, Ensemble Studio, and Richard Rogers. Finally, it concludes with appreciation for structural engineers and lists a few of the ones responsible for some of the most daring of delicate dangles.</span>

                    <span>The discussion around how we plan the cities we want to live in is a never-ending conversation. As our world experiences shifts that impact urban designs in both predictable and unpredictable ways, some principals have held true- that cities that rely less on private transportation, create walkable neighborhoods, boast a multitude of public parks and spaces, and are designed at a more human scale tend to be favored and well-recieved by the people who inhabit them. Enter the concept of New Urbanism. Backed by these ideologies with a modern spin on is how they might apply to our 21st-century lifestyles, New Urbanism a planning strategy that has been both praised and critiqued since its implementation.</span>

                    <span>Sou Fujimoto Architects have revealed the winning design of the New City Center Landmark, a monumental floating tower on the bay of the Qianhaiwan district in Shenzhen. The proposed tower is 268m high, and consists of 99 individual tower-like elements connected a strong horizontal plane in the upper part, gradually vanishing as they descend. It is both one tower and a collection of towers all at once, symbolizing the future of societies in an age of diversity.</span>

Issues linked to the relationship between the built environment, sexual orientation, and gender identity, however, remain particularly understudied, perhaps because of their relative invisibility and less clearly identifiable discriminatory consequences. Moreover, they are also completely neglected by design theory in the Francophone world. This article partially remedies the situation.</span>

                    <span>The architecture of urban bazaars works on a scheme of a mélange; it seems to be the leitmotif for such programmes, introducing a kind of ride through spaces and experiences that are controlled and enhanced through architectural forms and materiality. The visual mélange produces an architectural scenario for the activity of leisure and pleasure, an indulgence in shopping as well as the feeling of partaking in actions related to craft and culture. It creates an urban scope that inserts itself within a different reality; like in an amusement park, a bubble of reality within the everyday reality of the city outside.</span>

永远沉默的世界里
只有你和我交谈……

——阿赫玛托娃
夜之城所忘却的比它所铭记的还要更多。
这颗西海岸的闪耀尘埃爱的是谋杀在霓虹冠冕溅出的温暖血色；爱的是诡计吐出气息挑动雾织面纱，节律宛如潮汐浸泡的心跳；爱的是数不清的人与物在毗邻深渊处扭转身躯，献上支足抵刀尖的求欢之舞，只为博取它一时一刻的青眼相加。然后，这些胜出者，这些最顶尖的投资掮客、中间人、黑客、独狼、街头小子，会像被引领到婚床前的新娘那样羞红着脸庞，等待荣耀时刻毫无保留地从天而降，甜腻芬芳的丝绒糖霜一同飘然坠落。没有人再见过他们，只余下几个代号、一段传说，灿烂但不体面的故事随酸雨流遍每条陋巷，如同鮟鱇的诱饵，吸引着骨头太过细弱的小鱼步入光亮也步入消亡。
不论如何，死在百余年前的俄国诗人与一位不入流的超梦演员都注定无法成为上述图景的一部分，而这个道理，艾斯黛拉在她十九岁那年才学到——从54台那儿。彼时她刚刚完成一段广告片的拍摄，如今回想起来，其规格简陋得让人不忍言表：仅有一下午的拍摄期，外景拿廉价特效蒙混充数，而导演也是个从商业片一路滑落到影碟市场的失意者，才华日益消退，脾气不断增长。可即便如此，为了在深夜广告里出镜的十五秒，她还是要与其他二十个绝望程度相当的年轻姑娘拼死相争。
时隔许久，她依然无法得知自己究竟因何脱颖而出。夜之城不缺漂亮脸蛋，而一整年的表演艺术夜校对此似乎也没太多积极影响。她唯一得到的线索来自片场助理，“考虑到主题是有机食品，我们当然也想找个看不出植入物疤痕的模特。如果下巴垫得再不着痕迹些，那就更好了。这么一来，你可能是最符合条件的应聘者了。”
她非常清楚地记得对方耸了耸肩，暗示自己不打算对这番论断负责，紧接着把视线移回手机屏幕，全神贯注地盯着几组交叠爬升的彩色光带。每一道光带都与某件投入信息流的爆炸新闻相关联，从其高度，可以一窥它激起的浪涌。
“你叫艾斯黛拉·…</span>

                    <span>继上周五开发者日志Vol.5展出了【渗透者】与【入侵者】第一波商品共8名角色的彩模造型之后，本周的开发者日志为大家带来重大发表！那就是，公认锤圈大佬源质下巴加盟本系列担当预热背景故事与人物角色小传的编撰！先让我们来看看下巴的加盟视频吧！




事不宜迟！让我们同步带来源质下巴为JoyToy产品系列撰写好之后，经过Games Workshop监修通过官方承认的预热背景故事吧：
警戒星战役
早在阿巴顿挥下魔剑之前，警戒星就已经陷入连绵恶战，战火在七大巢都节区同时燃起，而在战帅的大军踏上这片土地之后，情况就更是急转直下。警戒星元老院被迫将残余军力从多个帝国控制区域中撤出，混沌星际战士叛军、亚空间恶魔、兽人入侵者、黑暗灵族海盗与基因窃取者教团在人类的土地上对彼此开战，这个关键世界的局势危如累卵，行将崩溃。
极限战士的欧克塔维奥小队与罗穆洛小队曾经分别受命，在死林节区深处对抗进行渗透破坏的血斧兽人特战小子，而当战局突变时，他们接到了极限战士战团长卡尔加的新命令：探查出死林节区统治者藏匿的位置。这座秘密要塞中保管着六枚状况完好的死亡直击导弹，这些末日武器的威力足以撕裂现实，在即将到来的决战中会成为破局关键。警戒星总督的血亲兄弟统治着死林节区，这名腐败贵族拒绝合作，但在整个世界的存亡关头，他的个人意见已经不再重要了。
两支先锋小队在此前的战斗中都遭受了损失，现在渗透者小队和入侵者小队进行了临时合并，这八名原铸星际战士必须踏入被混沌恶魔与暴徒蹂躏的节区中心，穿越半座已经被帝国军队放弃的巢城，他们的行动将永远改变整个警戒星战区的命运。
源质下巴为大家带来基于警戒星战役的预热背景故事，大家觉得观感如何？我个人非常期待封存在每一位角色商品中人物卡片中的人设，以及对应的剧情！
官图上线
此外JoyToy今天也同步放出了两张最新的官方商品图片，以便大家更完整的领略商品角色的带来的魅力：




值得一说的是，该组官图是经过GW监修过后才能放出来的照片，理应是非常接近大货的真实样貌了。正如本周公布的视频所指，近期应该官方会开启正式的预售节点，请喜爱本系列商品的朋友们持续关注啦。
让我们一期来期待下周的开发者日志吧！</span>

                    <span>由彼得·杰克逊打造的披头士乐队全新纪录片《披头士乐队：回归》（The Beatles: Get Back）终于定档，将于今年11月上线 Disney+ 流媒体平台。
该纪录片由60多小时未公布的视频素材、150多小时未公开的音频素材汇编而成，记录了披头士如何录制出经典专辑《Let It Be》（原名为《Get Back》）的全过程。




1970年5月8日，《Let It Be》专辑发行，而当时乐队刚分崩离析。而此次纪录片还将收录披头士那场著名的演出——在伦敦萨维尔街苹果唱片公司总部旧址屋顶上的表演。





(彼得·杰克逊制作花絮)
在此次的披头士纪录片中，杰克逊将延用纪录片《他们已不再变老》中的影像复原技术来处理这些视频。乐队成员保罗·麦卡特尼、林戈·斯塔尔以及小野洋子、奥利维亚·哈里森两位乐队成员遗孀也参与了这次合作。麦卡特尼说：“我真的很高兴彼得深入我们的档案，制作了一部展示披头士乐队录制专辑真实历史的电影。”
《披头士乐队：回归》将分为三部分，每部长约两小时，分别将于今年11月25日、26日和27日上线流媒体 Disney+ 流媒体平台，敬请期待。

                    <span>战斗机
在《武装突袭3》早期，游戏中是没有战斗机的，本身这也不是个空战游戏。但是随着喷气机DLC的推出，游戏也引入了舰载战斗机和一个空战任务。这个DLC本身没多大分量，就，挺像是拆出来卖的坑货。不说废话，先来介绍一下游戏中这几种造型极其怪异的战斗机吧。
游戏中一共有三种战斗机：北约的F/A-181、阿尔蒂斯的A-149和广盟的To-201，都是相当混搭的造型。先说说F/A-181，这是一架双发的舰载战斗机，从这个名字上可以看出它的原型就是F/A-18，然而它相比之下采用了大量的隐形设计，整体的硬朗直线风格又很像F-22。当然我们都知道F-22不是舰载机，现实中服役的隐形舰载机只有F-35C，这么说来F/A-18、F-22和F-35C都可以看作是F/A-181的原型，这也真够可以的。


(隐形模式下的F/A-181)(机翼下可以挂载空空和空地导弹)(处于机身侧舱内的空空导弹)(位于机头雷达上方的机炮，和F/A-18很像)(挂满武器的F/A-181正在起飞)(原型之一，F-22)(原型之二，F-35C)(原型之三，F/A-18)

再来看看广盟的To-201，和F/A-181一样，它也是隐形战机。To-201的机动性要比F/A-181更强，相应的是它的载弹量更少，只不过它的混搭风格甚至比F/A-181还要夸张。它机身下方两侧的进气口，两个尾喷口之间的探测器，略微低头的雷达舱说明它延续着“侧卫”家族的基因，尤其是后期的苏-35M。但是现实中的苏-57/T-50才是真正在延续“侧卫”家族的同时还具有隐形能力的战机，而这个To-201……姑且认为是基于苏-35，适当参考了苏-57的设计吧。


(六角迷彩的To-201)(位于机身侧面的30mmGsh机炮)(挂载于翼下的R-77导弹)(飞行中的To-201)(飞行中的苏-35)(飞行中的苏-57)

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.gcores.com/articles/138353">

                    <span>《战地风云 2042》设计总监 Daniel Berlin 于日前接受了 Epic 游戏商城的采访，开发者揭晓了就这款《战地风云》系列有史以来规模最大游戏的开发、设计、各种灵感的详情，同时还确认预告中有玩家未发现的彩蛋，要点如下：




Daniel Berlin 表示，游玩预告片中的确有些东西是他们尚未揭晓的。他个人期待看到玩家社群通过分析预告片的每一帧，对预告片进行剖析。有鉴于全新的地图以及128名玩家同台竞技， 所以工作室也必须使用全新的方式进行关卡设计。


其内部,他们将这种方式叫做群集（Clustering）——先打造出地图上那些格外具有特色的、充满了各种资源和物品资源的区域，比如在体育馆这张地图上，整个馆内有多个要点需要占领，而要彻底占领体育馆，玩家就需要通过战斗，打穿好几个这样的战略要点，而这种方式实际上是基于前作的经验。


Daniel Berlin 指出，从始至终，团队一直追求的都是沙盒化。沙盒化一直是《战地》的核心 DNA 的核心部分。本作是一款沙盒射击游戏，为了向玩家提供这些巨大的游玩空间，开发者要用到手头各种不同的工具，而现在拜最新的科技所赐，这些工具也进行了现代化的更新。


当将这些要素全部融入同一个巨大战场时，《战地风云》的特色就奠定了。比如，战场上有一队步兵在移动，但同时也会有坦克，天上有喷气机，还有直升飞机。当这些用全新科技翻新的要素与巨大的地图互相结合时，它们就会相互交融，并创造出一种玩起来符合《战地风云》系列游戏风格的游玩体验。  
值得一提的是，虽然没有单人游玩的战役，开发团队将仍旧通过在线服务，为大家呈现一个引人入胜的故事，我们将通过逐步推出的各类专家来向大家展现这个不断进化的世界中的故事。哪怕玩家只想单人游玩，也能通过和 AI 士兵对战进行体验。当然，同时也可以和朋友以及 AI 一起对战 AI。
 


关于反作弊，Daniel Berlin 则强调称，让玩家们享受无骚扰，无作弊的游戏体验对他们至关重要。在 EA 内部有一个名叫 Positive Play 的系统，而《战地风云 2042》也将加入这个系统。工作室也将于未来提供有关于诸如跨平台游玩之类的更多信息。 
在谈到打造这个未来和真实性兼备的浸入式体验时，Daniel Berlin 指出他们设定舞台和这些要点简直是严丝合缝，不管是从时间，还是名称的角度来说均是如此。然而他们同时还想打造一个我们的特种兵们能够存在，并具有有趣的背景故事的世界。他们还想将这个动态的世界的潜能发挥到极限，做一些离经叛道的事情，比如，彻底摒弃创意限制，跳出固化的思维。</span>

                    <span>在当代的生活中，相比于大街小巷中唾手可得的啤酒而言，葡萄酒更多地出现在宴请以及社交场合。作为酒精饮料的一员，葡萄酒从刚刚诞生起就被当时的贵族奉为了座上宾，似乎天生就被赋予了婆罗门的光环。从古埃及留存的壁画中，我们也可以一窥当时的权贵们对于葡萄酒的喜爱。

(《乌尔王军旗》，描述了5000年前苏美尔人的生活)
在军旗的最上面一列中，我们不难看出这是群臣向君主敬酒的场景，而他们手中的酒杯中盛满的极有可能便是出自初期苏美尔原始工艺的葡萄酒，因为乌尔城（现伊拉克地区）并非葡萄酒产地，只有由两河流域进口葡萄酿制的葡萄酒才有资格登上大雅之堂。公元前2000年后，葡萄酒作为商品加入了古埃及与古希腊的贸易往来，再经由古希腊传入了整个欧洲，其中也自然包括了《酿造物语》的故事发生地，意大利。

(游戏中玩家的葡萄园所在的位置，请忽略笔者的酒庄名字)

(现实中位于意大利西北部的阿尔巴小镇)
意大利人将葡萄的种植方式大体分成两类：一种是让葡萄藤依附于其他树木进行生长，而另一种则是令其依附于木桩进行生长。到了近现代后，随着农业以及科学的不断进步，让葡萄藤攀附在人工搭建的支架上成为了更为合理的选择，坚固的支架不仅能为藤蔓起到稳定的支撑作用，也能在一定程度上控制葡萄的生长趋势，让其获得的日照更为充足。如今的葡萄园也多数采取这样的种植策略，《酿造物语》中玩家的葡萄园，无疑也是如此。

(玩家需要照顾到种植园的方方面面)
在《酿造物语》这款游戏里，玩家需要扮演一位对葡萄酒一无所知的普通人，从零开始经营起属于自己的葡萄园。在一次又一次的尝试中，玩家在体验经营葡萄园乐趣的同时，也能逐步学习到葡萄酒基本的酿造过程以及围绕葡萄本身的一些知识。
这一期，我们就从后往前，先给大伙讲一讲葡萄酒的五维和它们之间的联系。

(笔者第一次酿出来的葡萄酒，好像还行？)

评价葡萄酒的五个维度
 1. 酒体 
酒体（body）这个词第一眼读上去非常的抽象，我们可以简单地把它理解为葡萄酒的浓郁程度。要打个比方的话，汤的浓度和酒体的概念有一定相似的地方，喜欢喝牛奶的朋友也可以想象一下脱脂和全脂牛奶口感之间存在的差异。
除酒体以外的特征都会对酒体本身造成一定程度的影响。甜度，单宁和酒精都会增加葡萄酒的酒体，而酸度则会降低酒体。


2.甜度 
顾名思义，甜度（sweetness）衡量的就是一瓶葡萄酒经过发酵后剩余的含糖量。
通常来说，甜度越高的酒也越粘稠，而我们常听到的干型，甜型也与甜度有直接的联系。 从甜度从低到高排序（括号内为每升中含多少克糖）： 

极干型 Bone Dry（120g/L)


3. 单宁 
葡萄酒中最值得称道的成分就是单宁（Tannin），因为其有抑制胆固醇以及降低脂肪肝等对功效，使得人们对葡萄酒大为赞赏。当然，过量饮用葡萄酒肯定是有害的。
单宁的特点就是它苦涩的味道，主要的来源是葡萄皮和葡萄籽，对于葡萄酒的酿造而言，它们也能起到减缓氧化以及维持葡萄酒稳定性的作用。佳丽酿酒一般是葡萄酒中涩度最低的，而最高的则是萨格兰蒂诺酒。用啤酒来作为对比的话，IPA，双倍IPA以及三倍IPA大约可以概括单宁在上述例子中的跨度。 


4. 酸度 
酸度（acidity）同样是一个直白的指标。首先我们要明确一个概念，没有不酸的葡萄酒，只有没那么酸的和更酸的。酸度比较低的葡萄酒品尝起来会比较甜，酒体也更加饱满。相对的，酸度较高的葡萄酒更为轻盈和苦涩许多。不恰当的酸度往往会导致葡萄酒的味道失去特点或者过于强烈，一瓶优秀的葡萄酒通常都会在酸度上取得一个较好的平衡。 


5. 酒精 
葡萄酒的酒精含量通常在15%左右，甜度越高的葡萄酒中酒精的含量可能越高。由于酒精的含量不好在酿造过程中精确量化，在游戏中制作方引入了“典型性”这样一个名词，用来形容玩家酿出来的酒在当地所有同类酒中具有代表性，想必他们也做了许多实地考察（指品尝大量葡萄酒）。这也从侧面评价了玩家对葡萄酒酿造的掌握程度。 
以上就是第一期关于葡萄酒的内容啦！下一期我们会梳理一遍葡萄酒的酿造过程！对《酿造物语》感兴趣的朋友也可以去商店页面看看这款游戏是否合自己的胃口！

原载于GWB游戏无界公众号 
大家好，我是一名热爱第一人称射击游戏的游戏爱好者和从业者。《使命召唤》和《战地》系列是我从小便结下不解之缘的FPS类型游戏。在十多年的游戏过程中，我体验了绝大部分上述系列游戏的内容并乐在其中。而在成为游戏从业者且长时间游玩体验了EA在2016年末出品的《战地1》后，我更加憧憬从一个设计者的角度去思考如何在相应类型玩家需求的框架下，去创造和设计符合其体验的游戏内容，故而有了此浅文。可能全文内容做不到极致的夯实丰富，也可能会出现部分功夫尚显不够的考究，更别说有几率会出现的稀碎逻辑，如此种种，均望阅者能够多多包涵，如果我的抛砖引玉能够引起您的眉头紧锁，并输出多样的看法和建议，那可是最好不过的了。 



1.简介
They push,we push,Every once in a while,we push hard enough with the light break through the clouds and the world beyond war glimmers,just out of reach。The war is the world,and the world is the war.

他们前进，我们反击，有时我们战斗直到阳光穿透云层，而和平的曙光，遥不可及，战争就是这个世界，这个世界满是战争。
相信玩过《战地1》的朋友们都知道游戏序章中出现的这段标志性的旁白。这部在2016年由EA出品的《战地》系列游戏充满了人文气息和反战思想。游戏设定在第一次世界大战时期，包含了很多新的系列元素，比如马、火焰喷射器、双翼飞机和齐柏林飞艇。
《战地》系列向来擅于营造大战场氛围，而今天我要和诸位分享讨论的便是以《战地1》为切入点，简要分析开发商DICE是通过哪些方法实现大战场氛围的营造的。

                    <span>Demo不能代表游戏质量，但是当它的Demo都那么好玩的时候，你就知道这个游戏是有多好了。
序言
Demo版本只有两个Class，也就是士兵、盾哥。Demo里他们的技能也跟1代有所不同，但是定位都是一样的。具体机制有什么变化现在讲了估计后面还是会改的，所以就不考究了。


画面，基础体验
最先进入我们视野的是游戏更新的3d画面，效果如何且看截图。而优化问题，我可以说我的1060不能在最高画质下稳定60帧，但是能够忍受。毕竟2代切换到Unity引擎（应该是）总比1代的软件稳定性要高。
操作、打击感个人体验跟1代类似，但是视野变大，瞄准需要更多时间适应，而场景复杂起来，障碍物也多了，弹道怎么走也是个眼花花的问题。


这次敌人被打爆会各种布娃娃碎尸，有蓝色的能量护盾视觉特效。一个明显的问题是，部分敌人死亡后，例如机甲，机甲的残骸掉在地上会挡住去路以及弹道，残骸依然有生命值，可以被打爆。但是现在的敌人AI并不会主动去打爆挡住路的残骸，而且敌人掉落的物品会卡在残骸里面。
当然敌人蹦数字，伤害溢出爆大红叉叉还是保留了的。
Demo的敌人种类完全不输1代，有近战（这是2代新增的）有远程狙击有敌方盾哥……还有新增的机器狗。

(地形杀变得特别有意思，这个是什么电磁通道之类的)
游戏战斗操作起来跟前作变化并不大，1代的经验完全可以移植过来。不过热量条未免暗了点。地图依然随机，但是有明显向某个目标前进的感觉。从基地外面打入基地内部，再由电梯前往深处。
昏暗的地图，有气氛，更加能体验光影特效，但是准星看不见。


3d化带来的一切
从2d纸片人变3d游戏，整个游戏的动画数量跟1代相比完全不是一个量级的，对比一代几乎只有上弹动作比较复杂，2代各种加速跑动、退后射击、移动射击的复杂动画都有体现，可谓是豪华。而新加入的z轴可谓是超维度地丰富了游戏本身。
游戏里有了垂直体验，世界不再是平的。
但是作为一个俯视角射击游戏，1代的hitbox问题，也就是子弹命中判定的问题延续到了2代。你觉得打中了它就是打不中，2代的这个demo里最为直观的例子是里面的小型炮塔。小型炮塔的模型类似于三脚架摄像机，而炮管才是本体，也就是说看起来那么大的一个东西，你要是打不中他三脚架中间那个小块块，它就是没有反应。反观大型炮塔，一个长方体盒子，打哪儿都中。
这在《Synthetik》的游戏机制里，是个非常严重的问题。《Synthetik》里决定敌人强度的关键实际上不仅仅在于敌人的血量，由于《Synthetik》的每场1对1小型战斗的时间都非常短，敌我的“击杀时间”都不长，能否命中敌人的这一因素对战斗的影响与武器伤害几乎处于同等地位。



(蜜汁高低差)
很明显建筑物挡住东西老生常谈的问题，不知道正式版要怎么改动。 这次它挡住的东西更加多了，3d俯视角还是挺能折腾人的直觉的。总不能指望改成TPS或者是FPS吧？


另外，Demo里的商店有妹子，怎么能有妹子？如此堕落的行为，必须批判！

(女人！是女人！啊啊啊啊)
总而言之，喜欢1代玩不够，2代不玩没道理。
8月开放EA测试，射击，卸弹夹，装填，射击！</span>

    						When I began this project, I thought I&#x27;d be documenting the seasonal changes that seem to take place in the Yukon over long, drawn-out periods of endless winter and brilliant summer. Ultimately, I found that the landscape I had chosen to document changed, not only seasonally, but by the hour.
 
I chose to focus on the view from the lake where I lived at the time. There, I realized that the transformations I’d always assumed took place slowly, actually happened in measurable increments I could miss, if I looked away for too long. Ice formed and melted, altering the water from midnight to noon. In a matter of minutes, sudden winds whipped the lake’s glassy, reflective surface into frothing waves. If the sky opened up, or dark storm clouds rolled in to create a change of light, I made my way down the winding path (often running) from my house to the lake, camera in hand. 

Over the 20 months I spent on this project, I became more and more aware of the ever-changing light in the North. 

I noticed how even subtle changes elicited an entirely different mood from the landscape. I became obsessed with visiting the lake and seeing what it had to show me.Website ︎︎︎ ︎

                    <span>Jade is a midrise multi-unit residential building in Salmiya, Kuwait. The design of the building aims to facilitate an urban and sustainable way of living for young families. The building occupies a compact urban lot in a high-density area, straddling the upscale Arabian Gulf Road and the less affluent inner-city neighbourhoods. North and west facades are privileged for their open views defining the building&#x27;s image through an understated yet expressive design.</span>

                    <span>The exhibition design follows these lines of thought: Fieldwork: the resurrection of Henrique Galvão’s 1934 map, a complex referential transnational framework. Translation: the very actual and misused topic of borders, peripheries, nations dictating conventions on one side of a line against what might happen on the other. Lines: suggested by a deformed, half invisible grid offering potential narratives of referential diversity, blurring north-south orientations. Geography: an insinuated three-dimensional space grid eludes any clear belonging. Choice: “if I had to choose between The Doors and Dostoyevsky, then – of course – I’d choose Dostoyevsky. But do I have to choose?” (Susan Sontag in Jonathan Cott, The Complete Rolling Stone Interview, Yale University Press, 2013).</span>

Situated in Clapham Old Town the design reorders the ground and first floor layouts and adds a new open-plan kitchen and living space beneath an expansive 2-storey void. On entry to the house, the young family is given immediate axial views through the extended building footprint to the kitchen and main living space. The generously proportioned entrance gives way to the dining area which links together the front reception room and the kitchen.</span>

Their firm worked on a diverse array of projects, with designs for exhibitions, furniture, houses, monuments, and toys. Together they developed manufacturing processes to take advantage of new materials and technology, aiming to produce high-quality everyday objects at a reasonable cost. Many of their furniture designs are considered contemporary classics, particularly the Eames Lounge &amp; Shell Chairs, while the Eames House is a seminal work of architectural modernism.</span>

                    <span>Adaptive reuse or the process of transforming an older building by reusing the structure and changing its original purpose, has gained relevance over the years especially because it allows a complete optimization of the performance of the existing built environment. In a piece, originally published on Metropolis, author Elissaveta Brandon explores how &quot;architects and developers are transforming the staples of the South—located throughout a 120-mile region from Winston-Salem to Fayetteville—into infrastructure fit for today&quot;. Transforming historic mills into design hubs, and mixed-use complexes, the article highlights 3 examples from North Carolina.</span>

                    <span>The site is located in a protected natural habitat; Working with environmental and conservation authorities on the project was a challenge but also an inspiration for the project. Building such a structure with a hidden beam ninety feet long and a cantilevered green roof was one design challenge. The second was the cradle and stair in a thin shell steel structure. Getting permits and then getting through the engineering and materiality challenges of the noted architectural elements were a huge relief to achieve at the level we did. We are really happy and proud of the outcomes.</span>

                    <span>Did You See This?
    Lizzie Borden’s Working Girls (1986)    		
Summer’s heating up. As many of us venture back into theaters, institutions such as Film at Lincoln Center and the Museum of the Moving Image are announcing programs that offer the opportunity to see revivals and new releases on their big screams or at home via streaming. FLC’s season features highlights from last fall’s New York Film Festival and this spring’s New Directors/New Films, while MoMI’s First Look 20/21, running from July 22 through August 1, will blend as-yet-unseen highlights from last year’s edition with brand new works of innovative moving image art. BAMcinemaFest, Brooklyn’s showcase of independent film, opens Wednesday for a week-long run. And in Chicago, the Tribune’s Michael Phillips previews Doc10, the city’s “small but vital” festival of nonfiction filmmaking running through the weekend.
Cannes jury president Spike Lee is on the festival’s newly revealed poster. Meanwhile, organizers have announced that Arthur Harari’s Onada - 10000 Nights in the Jungle, the true story of a Japanese Army officer who carried on fighting the Second World War on an island in the Philippines for twenty-nine years, will open Un Certain Regard on July 7. The jury for that program will be headed up by Andrea Arnold. Looking ahead to the tail end of summer, Venice has confirmed that Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, starring Timothée Chalamet, will premiere out of competition on September 3.


This week’s highlights:



A new 4K restoration of Lizzie Borden’s Working Girls (1986) opens at IFC Center in New York this weekend, and writing for the New York Times, J. Hoberman finds it “as witty, gimlet-eyed, and discomfiting as when it won a special award at the 1987 Sundance Film Festival.” It’s also “an anticapitalist critique that has scarcely dated.” Molly (Louise Smith) is a photographer who turns trick at a Manhattan brothel to make ends meet. “Is it all worth it?” asks Erika Balsom at 4Columns. “Costs and benefits make up the calculus of survival, and Working Girls is all about keeping track of the ever-changing tally, without passing judgment.”




Before the Berlinale wraps this weekend, a special Teddy Award will be presented to Jenni Olson, a filmmaker, curator, and historian who, as the Teddy Foundation puts it, “embodies, lives, and creates queer film culture.” Best known for her essay films The Joy of Life (2005) and The Royal Road (2015), both of which are available on the Criterion Channel, Olson has spent decades putting together programs of vintage 35 mm movie trailers and gathering prints, negatives, digital masters, and production and distribution documentation related to LGBTQ cinema. The Harvard Film Archive acquired her collection last summer. “I know it’s the industry side of it,” she tells Ryan Gilbey in the Guardian, “connecting filmmakers and festivals and distributors and all that, but it’s also been all about friendship. These people are my friends. They’re my life.”




Dorothy Arzner’s Merrily We Go to Hell was released in the summer of 1932, almost exactly two years before the studios were compelled to begin enforcing the Hayes Code. “It was a box-office hit, and its depiction of wedlock as a trap still has razor-sharp jaws,” writes Pamela Hutchinson in the Independent. Sylvia Sidney plays Joan, “a doe-eyed debutante” who falls for Jerry, “an alcoholic newspaper hack” played by Fredric March. The duo has “just enough awkward chemistry to foster hopes for their burgeoning romance.” But Merrily is “Arzner’s most ambivalent film about marriage, right up to its uncomfortable last scene, which makes a mockery of the idea of a happy ending.”




In the Spring 2017 issue of the Cine-Files, Mary Wiles wrote about Marguerite Duras and Jacques Rivette as “mavericks within the respective domains of film and literature from which they had emerged in the 1950s. As filmmakers, they were united in their mutual desire to conceive of a new relationship between the soundtrack and the image, to discover a new approach to acting that would involve musical space, and to achieve a radical transformation of the male-focused system of representation of mainstream cinema.” The new issue of photogénie gathers essays that further explore the oeuvres of these two filmmakers who, as Charlotte Wynant writes in the introduction, “developed aesthetics that both answered the call of their time and responded to an art history that far preceded them, showing an acute sensibility to the potential and limits of their medium, which they set out to both disclose and destroy.”




Introducing the seventh issue of MAI, editors Anna Backman Rogers and Anna Misiak argue that television crime drama that “centers on the female detective offers one of the few spaces within global popular culture to address some of the cardinal conjectures and concerns of feminism: agency, autonomy, professional and personal identities, sexualized male violence, misogyny, race, gendered politics, and aging.” There are essays here on Jennifer Lopez in Shades of Blue and Carey Mulligan in Collateral, but also on series from Italy and Russia. “We wish you a calm and peaceful summer,” write Backman and Misiak, “and—most of all—happy reading.”

这一次使用的是夏普CE-152磁带机，这一台和夏普PC-1500一起进入到我国，市场上有非常大的存量，主要是用作数据的读写用途的。
在侧面具有REM接口，我认为是用于从磁带机端控制PC-1500实现同步读写，因为磁带机是机械控制。

                    <span>在今天凌晨微软来了 Xbox&amp;贝塞斯达发布会后的 Xbox Games Showcase Extended 游戏演示与开发者详解直播，期间公布了《地狱之刃2 塞纳传奇》全新幕后制作与概念设计预告，《盗贼之海》与《加勒比海盗》联动的全新预告片“盗贼之海：A Pirate&#x27;s Life”，我们将在其中与 Jack Sparrow 船长一同踏上全新的冒险，面对众多敌人与未知的宝藏。Xbox Design Lab 也正式推出了 Xbox Series X/S 手柄自定义服务。



(全程官方中文字幕)
首先，来自 PlayGround 的 Mike Brown 带来了将于11月9日正式发售的《极限竞速：地平线5》。游戏中除了将包含全部真实的墨西哥地貌与赛道外，PlayGround 更是捕捉了超过400小时的 12K HDR 天空数据，力求为玩家带来最真实的天气体验。此外，在《极限竞速：地平线5》中的 EventLab 将成为玩家和社区之间最受欢迎的创作与游玩场所，大家可以在该模式下设计任何你能想象到的东西，并设置游玩规则，所有玩家都能尽情享受该模式。








《极限竞速：地平线5》将于11月9日正式登陆 Xbox Series X/S、Win 10 商店、Steam 以及 Xbox Game Pass。拥有 XGP 订阅的玩家可以在游戏发售后的第一时间内开始游玩，如果你再加购或者直接购买 Premium 扩展包，则可以比购入其他版本的玩家提前一点玩到游戏。
随后，来自 Ninja Theory 的“创意忍者”Tameem 带来了《地狱之刃2 塞纳传奇》的最新开发进度介绍与创意预告。Tameem 表示，团队目前正在制作游戏中最重要的一部分，然后再进入全面开发阶段。而这款作品对他们来说非常特殊，开发组并不想做一款很直接的续作，而是想作更特别的东西。




据介绍，游戏背景设定在公元九世纪的冰岛，所以整个艺术团队都来到了冰岛进行拍摄于湿地摄影测量，对景观进行了大范围的重建。而在战斗方面，新作中将更加残酷且真实，女主演 Milena 为此还接受了两年的训练。








Double Fine 工作室的 Tim Schafer 带来了《脑航员2》的游玩演示与讲解，在本作中，我们将进入更多的大脑，其中前作反派 Caligosto Loboto 就包含在其中。在他被Raz打败后，算是互相成为了朋友。但他知道到底是谁绑架了 Truman Zanotto，可潜意识却阻止他向 Raz 透露任何消息。




我们在《脑航员 2》中将会发现谁给Raz家族下了诅咒，并探索脑航员的总部：母叶。《脑航员 2》将于8月25日正式登陆 Xbox Series X/S、PC、PlayStation 5 和 Xbox One 平台。


《潜行者 2》在直播活动上带了游玩演示详解，官方表示，游戏的全名为《潜行者 2 切尔诺贝利之心》，游戏将于4月28日正式发售同步加入 Xbox Game Pass。




《战地 2042》透露了部分“全面战争体验”模式的信息。其中包含海陆空所有战场，一并组成了一个大型战争。其内部再细分则包含“征服模式”与“突围模式”。在征服模式中，所有玩家将参与到一场十分庞大的沙盒式战斗中，当你们赢得战斗后，就能选择下一步想要前往的战场，通过运输车来到新的地区进行战斗。大家可以自由选择什么时候前往什么地点进行战斗。




而突围模式将加入更多的执导内容，我们将在一整张地图上展开战斗，玩家被分为进攻与防守队。而战场被压缩为特定空间的正面战斗，行动时间非常短暂。


随后 Jack Sparrow 船长正式登场，在该免费更新中我们将穿梭于《盗贼之海》与《加勒比海盗》两个世界之中，探寻《加勒比海盗》世界中的经典场景，与幽灵船员和嗜血海妖进行战斗，除此之外，千万不要忘了戴维琼斯正驾驶着“飞翔的荷兰人”正紧随其后。












343 Industries 也带来了《光环 无限》多人模式的详细介绍，其中我们在预告片中看到的女性角色，她是斯巴达学院负责人 Laurette 指挥官。《光环 无限》将于2021年假期在 PC、Xbox One 及 Xbox Series X | S 发售，首日登录 XGP。其多人对战模式将免费面向所有玩家。并将持续带来季度更新与全新模式、地图，以及以社区为中心的游戏内容。






最后，《猩红结系》带来了游戏背后的深度玩法设计介绍，更多详情请看直播全程中文字幕录像。</span>

                    <span>四十年前，超级拟态黑洞-不确定者在太阳系突然显现，从此之后，光被完全遮蔽，昼夜交替的概念被抹除，世人眼中只剩下永无止尽，却又见不到繁星的极黑之夜。
有趣的是，这也是不确定者为地球文明带来的唯一影响，她实际上并未使任何天体坍塌，仅仅是如同一块悬挂于苍穹之际的巨大黑色幕布，虽总令遥望星宇者背生恶寒，却未有多少实际威胁。
二十年前，也就是2058年，科学技术总局正式将不确定者归类为“超级拟态黑洞”，既昭示着她的巨大，也在某种程度上确认了她的无害性。仅仅是“拟态”，而非那些真正的，能够撕裂天体的可怕深邃之物。
两年后，在2060年的8月15日，随着曲速星舰远航技术在美洲国取得突破，地球文明正式进入了环太阳宇宙时代，而近距离接触甚至穿越不确定者，自然便成为了这个时代中，每一艘星舰与每一位宇航员的必经之路。
2065年9月10日，长江号曲速星舰在东亚酒泉基地发射，因曲速引擎的应用失控而产生时空爆炸，酒泉基地在这次危机中彻底废置。后出于安全问题考虑，以该基地为中心的广阔地域，被东亚国政府列为永久禁区。
2066年10月6号，新探索者号曲速星舰在美洲西部基地发射，星舰成功进入地外轨道，并于宇宙空间展开地球文明首次超光速跃进，但结果不尽理想。时至如今，文明都尚未寻得新探索者号的身影。
2067年12月12日，工农号曲速星舰在东欧普列谢茨克基地发射，星舰成功进入地外轨道，并成功展开超光速跃进。2068年1月7日，在中央政府的指令下，停泊许久的工农号展开二次超光速跃进，正式深入不确定者。这是文明本身首次与不确定者产生实际上的接触，其结果却相当遗憾，工农号及其所承载的三十六位宇航员们，本该作为人类史上最伟大的英雄凯旋，然而在进入不确定者内部之后，他们便与文明失去了联系。
2068年7月，西欧国政府原定于28日的联合号曲速星舰发射计划被中央勒令取消，原因是时任中央秘书长认为，连续两艘星舰的失踪已经给…</span>

弑亲者系列第一篇，金色角斗士的故事。
西方大陆的无冕之王在幕后默默守卫这片土地，有关他和他那些神秘莫测的子嗣，我们能知道的唯有下面这些文字。
1.童年之血
丘巴竭力望向竞技场，窗户太高，而他又太矮，哪怕手指扣住窗沿、踩上老旧头盔，也只能看见被铁栅分割的蓝天和一抹黄沙。而且这样的姿势太累人了。丘巴指尖发白，小腿抽搐。
他挪动了一下重心，希望能在半圆形的兜鍪上找个更舒服着力点。但是这一回他脚尖打滑了，就此重重跌落在地上，脊背和右肩都剧烈疼痛起来。
与此同时，竞技场之中爆发了狂热的喝彩。
自有意识以来就没有离开过竞技场的丘巴当然能够分辨出各种喝彩的区别，他在这里长大，熟知一切，清楚耳旁的喝彩是独属于有人死去的狂欢。这也不奇怪，今天是最糟的那种安排，七名角斗士，对战自南方草原捕获的巨兽，直至一方彻底死亡。今天流下的血，想必会填塞竞技场的下水道，腥味久久无法散去，接连一个月他们都将只能用这淡红的水洗漱。
但是，丘巴在心里高喊，但是，别是齐维。
别是齐维。
别是齐维。
就在这个期间，喝彩又一次爆发。齐维曾教过丘巴如何用手指计数，而他现在正这么做。这是第四个。超过一半的人死去了，而齐维从来都不是最强的。
不能再躺着了。丘巴咒骂自己，忍住疼痛的侵蚀，用尽意念从地上爬起，然后再一次踩上旧头盔。他费力将眼睛对齐窗户，却正好看见那巨兽扬起自己的巨大头颅。脏绿色的头颅裂开成四五瓣，颚内利齿排排环绕，上面挂着某人的一截残肢，软绵绵的垂在裂口边上。
头颅朝后方砸去，溅起了漫天的尘土。随着鲜血增多，看台上的呼声越来越高，丘巴却只感到手脚冰冷。别是齐维。他不断祈求，但越发觉得自己不过是在奢望。
这场比赛持续了很久，期间丘巴又两度滑落，肩膀上的疼痛似乎都已化作肿胀的淤青。当巨兽被杀死时，它发出了低沉恐怖的怒吼作为临终的遗言，但遗言很快又被观众们的呼喊盖过。他们在叫某人的名字，听上去不…</span>

                    <span>导语
自微软宣布将于6月24日举办网络发布会以来，有关 Windows 11 的传言就不绝于耳。出乎不少人预料的是，被誉为最后一代的 Windows 10 将于2025年退休，而“十年来最重要的更新”将会以 Windows 11  的形式呈现。
笔者也于近日体验了面向了开发者的早期构造版本，下面也和各位读者朋友聊聊新系统的一些亮点。




全新Fluent Design


笔者认为， Windows 11 的最大变化要属全面使用 Fluent Design 的 UI ，而这点从安装向导开始就相当明显。除了全面拥抱圆角设计以及全新的音效设计之外，全新设计的开始菜单、壁纸以及图标也确实给人眼前一亮的感觉。
需要注意的是，Windows 11 中任务栏默认居中，但用户也可通过设置改回传统样式。


Fluent Design 作为一种强调光线、深度、动画、材质与尺度的设计语言，与纯扁平化有着很大区别。正如下图所见，Windows 11 的设计语言相对传统扁平化而言更为强调质感、阴影，在使用得当的情况搭配亚克力效果也相当亮眼。

(传统扁平化对比Fluent Design )
比较遗憾的是，目前版本的 Windows 11 中仍然存在控制面板与设置的割裂情况（仅图标进行了更新），而这点也相当干扰用户的日常体验。尽管 Windows 一贯的强大兼容性对于所有人都是好事，但横跨两个版本仍然没有把所有选项整合至一起也让人颇感不解。同时，全新设计尽管看起来很美，但如同 Windows 10 一样，仍有不少地方需要加强。比如，选项卡的信息量要比传统设计低不少，无论是 Xbox 还是微软商城应用也一如既往的易用性偏低等等。这些也是笔者希望在正式版中微软能够优化的内容。
任务视图与小组件
在 Windows 11 中，微软强化了任务视图功能，同时还首次加入了名为小组件的图标。
任务视图是一个在 Windows 10 中首次引入的任务切换器和虚拟桌面系统，允许用户快速定位到已打开的窗口，快速隐藏所有窗口并显示另一个桌面，以及管理多个监视器或虚拟桌面上的窗口。尽管这一功能相当有用，但对于一些用户来说也太过复杂，而本次微软也特意简化了用户的操作难度，从而让更多用户体验这项功能。


就本次技术预览的体验而言，新增的小组件与 Windows 10 中的“资讯与兴趣”十分类似。在小组件中，用户可以查看最新天气、阅读故事以及信息流。正如同“资讯与兴趣”，除了查看天气之外目前的用处可以说是不大。


除了任务视图与小组件之外，用户还可自定义开始菜单中的常用图标以及经常使用应用。同时，通过鼠标摇晃窗口来最小化其他程序功能的功能现在也可以在设置中进行关闭。
最后，存储感知还新增了“游戏”、“家庭”、“创意工作”等预设，用户可选择最符合自己电脑使用的情景，Windows 根据这些情景进行优化。


结语
以技术预览版来看，Windows 11 相对而言是一次稳健保守的升级。根据 Linus Tech Tips 的测试，无论是游戏还是日常软件的运行都毫无问题，相信届时的正式升级也将是一次顺滑无缝的体验。当然，目前版本还远非正式版本，也很期待微软会在发布会中揭晓的更多全新功能以及设计。




除了新增内容之外，笔者还注意到 Windows 11 自带了 Xbox 游戏应用，这也代表玩家将首次无需下载额外应用便可直接体验 Xbox Game Pass 游戏。依笔者之见，对微软自家游戏的整合也印证着微软在此领域的野心以及愿景。
笔者最后也要强调，不推荐读者使用该早期构造版本的 Windows 11 作为日常使用的系统，不仅目前中文支持不完全，安全性也得不到保障。</span>

一个常常困扰着艺术评论的问题是，我们要如何去衡量一位艺术家或一种艺术风格的影响力？
必须承认，美感的渗透是一件私人而又主观的事情，因而多数时候，它都以最隐蔽的方式发生。但这个过程有时也会被主动公开，通过创作者之口或创作者之手被不加遮掩地表白示众。
比如之前我们曾经专门介绍过的日本国宝级画师天野喜孝（←点击查看）就公开表示自己深受新艺术大师阿尔方斯·穆夏（Alphonse Mucha）的影响。而如果要提名一位最常被日本漫画家们公认的风格导师的话，阿尔方斯·穆夏也一定名列前茅。


穆夏这个名字对于熟悉平面设计和插画艺术的人都不会陌生，他是新艺术运动的代表，是招贴海报的宗师泰斗，是广告设计的超级巨星。关于他的风格，只要上网随便搜索一下，就能被充斥屏幕的风情万种和柔情蜜意熏得目眩神迷。

(《Monaco Monte Carlo》)

(《The Precious Stones》)

(《Seasons》)
穆夏也不只是艺术圈的宠儿，他的通俗性和流行性令他在任何一个时代都广受欢迎，你总能在一些意想不到的生活场景中与他不期而遇。

(电影《好莱坞往事》中莎朗·塔特的卧室装饰就是穆夏《Season》中的《Autumn》)
而在各类风格迥异的日本动漫画里，你也同样时常会突然嗅到来自穆夏的香甜气息，被几乎要从书本和屏幕里疯长出来的植物撩动心神。

(《绝望先生》第7话)

(《GOSICK》OP)

(《JOJO的奇妙冒险：不灭钻石》第20话)
不用费心挖掘就能看到，穆夏的遗产在世界流行文化的田野里四处掉落，俯拾皆是。即使是最勤劳的拾穗者恐怕也很难把它们全部收罗，一一陈列。
这篇文章，我们就来集中地聊一聊“穆夏风格”在日本动漫画中的风靡，以及这种风靡背后的根源所在。 

穆夏其人
穆夏生于1860年的捷克摩拉维亚，当时这个地区还隶属于奥匈…</span>

                    <span>日本东京工业大学在前些日子举办了纸飞机比赛，将纸揉成一团扔出去的人拿了第三名。他将得到的奖状po到了网上，第一名看到了前来评论：他也是用的纸团。这件事在日推上成为了话题。






季军表示，把纸揉成一团丢出去就得了个奖状。他在评论里说明了比赛的规则：

一架飞机最多可用两张A3大小的制图纸
能用的东西是制图纸、胶水、配重物
配重物限定在20个回形针以内
用测量飞行距离和飞行时间的综合分数比赛
飞行距离是测量起点到纸飞机停止位置的地面距离
飞行时间是从起飞到机体一部分最初接触地面的时间，使用秒表测量
不能使用发射装置
综合分数使用换算公式计算
由此可见，季军的“纸飞机”并没有违反规则。不过他也表示，今年捏成一团可行，估计明年就不行了。


巧的是，冠军看到了他的推文，表示不约而同也用了纸团，二人光速认亲。季军说，冠军也抱着同样的想法，往纸飞机里放了20个回形针并尽可能团成圆形扔了出去。那么问题来了，亚军是不是也用了纸团拿奖状呢？</span>

《巴别号漫游指南》是一款以“蝴蝶效应”为核心的剧情冒险游戏。在本作的设定中，人类在死亡之后会经历一段非常奇特的旅程。他们会先被河豚吞下，来到一艘名为“巴别号”的巨轮。这些亡者来到巴别号之后，首先会被巨大的瓢虫运走，再搭乘名为“泪杉专列”的火车前往记忆提取室。在记忆提取仪的作用下，他们会忘掉过去所经历的一切。




在 Demo 中，玩家将可以体验到游戏开篇的部分剧情，以两位主人公——刚刚登船的布雷斯和巴别号厨师长兰奇的身份，体验“蝴蝶效应”带来的乐趣。 而在正式版游戏中，玩家将以四位主角的视角展开冒险。几位主人公的身份各异，在巴别号上行动的理由也各不相同。随着巴别号背后隐藏的秘密一点点被揭开，大家的“人生”轨迹逐渐交织。 








《巴别号漫游指南》预计登陆 Steam 、iOS 和安卓平台，目前本作已经在Steam和TapTap开启预约。</span>

写在前面
本文将不讨论赛马文化所包含的包括配种、博彩行业等种种糟粕，只通过游戏本身以及其多媒体企划带来的影响，来阐述《赛马娘》这款手机游戏为什么能够大获成功。

「Make Debut!」：何为《赛马娘》？
《赛马娘（ウマ娘 プリティーダービー）》是什么？
它是一项不只是手机游戏，也在动画和漫画等等方面开展的多媒体企划。而这个企划的特征，顾名思义，就是“赛马”。
由赛马拟人化而来的角色，就是“赛马娘”。通过游戏来培养赛马娘，通过动画等等媒介来了解赛马娘们的故事，这就是《赛马娘》这一企划所推崇的理念。
那么赛马娘又是什么呢？
赛马娘是和人类不同、继承了原型赛马的名字和灵魂，有着和人类女性相近的外表的存在。从动画中可以看出，她们和人类一样都是杂食动物……不过非常喜欢胡萝卜。


在《赛马娘》的世界观中，赛马娘取代了原本的“马”的存在，其身体能力和现实中的马相同，几乎可以以每小时六十至七十公里的速度进行奔跑。此外，在人类的认知中，赛马娘相当于明星或者偶像，在作为“运动家”的同时，也肩负着身为“偶像”的使命。因此，赛马娘不光是需要比赛，也要在比赛结束后进行所谓的“胜者舞台”来进行偶像表演，而其中比赛第一名的赛马娘将作为表演中的C位，进行歌唱舞蹈的演出。

(不会跑步的偶像不是好运动员)
不过，在设定上，和现实中的赛马有所不同，赛马娘不存在骑手，因此与其说赛马娘是赛马，倒不如说更像是径赛选手。比赛时接受训练员的作战指示，在维持心理层面健康的同时，自己思考什么时候该发力冲刺、什么时候需要忍耐，来和其他赛马娘们争夺比赛的第一。而与现实中的赛马更加不一样的是，赛马娘的比赛不存在赌博性质，因此来观看比赛的人们，都只是希望自己单推的赛马娘能够成为第一而为她们加油鼓气。
紧张刺激的“比赛”和热情洋溢的“偶像LIVE”，这就是《赛马娘》企划的两个核心要素。

                    <span>Maker Stations based in sunny Leith, Edinburgh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

I love WFH. Offices can be fun in their way, but I always struggled to focus in a noisy, open environment. That (and a famous virus thing that made us stuck at our homes) prompted me to look for some desk inspiration.

I had a blast browsing home office setups &amp; battle stations on Reddit, but… I always wanted to learn more about the insights and the makers behind them. Pictures just weren’t enough.

This frustration led me to launch Maker Stations (using an incredibly fast Ghost platform!), a blog dedicated to home offices and mindful living: www.makerstations.io 🏠👨‍💻

We curate beautiful &amp; functional home office setups from makers around the globe, and, most importantly, feature stories of people behind them🎙️

I run Maker Stations together with my partner in crime @elenailford (she’s an amazing editor and hopeless introvert). We hope our blog will inspire you to upgrade your home office, build one from scratch or flick through the setups and look at the photos from those who did.

We’d appreciate it if you could spread the word about our blog with whoever might find it useful: friends, colleagues or fellow makers 👊

Get updates on Twitter, Instagram and consider subscribing to our weekly newsletter.

Now, let’s go and make something happen!

Cheers,
Ilya

Simulation empowers various engineering disciplines to quickly prototype with minimal human effort. In robotics, physics simulations provide a safe and inexpensive virtual playground for robots to acquire physical skills with techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, as the hand-derived physics in simulations does not match the real world exactly, control policies trained entirely within simulation can fail when tested on real hardware — a challenge known as the sim-to-real gap or the domain adaptation problem. The sim-to-real gap for perception-based tasks (such as grasping) has been tackled using RL-CycleGAN and RetinaGAN, but there is still a gap caused by the dynamics of robotic syst…</span>

                    <span>Julianne Moore in Todd Haynes’s Far from Heaven (2002)    		
With Cannes just three weeks away, filmmakers, producers, and distributors are preparing to shop the projects they’ve been working on. As Screen’s Melanie Goodfellow reports, European distributor Wild Bunch will bring to market one of its largest slates in years. Among the standouts is Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne’s Tori and Lokita, the story of two teens who have each arrived alone in Belgium from Africa; they bond over the hardships of exile. Arnaud Desplechin, whose adaptation of Philip Roth’s Deception will screen in the festival’s new Cannes Premiere program, is already at work on Brother and Sister, featuring Marion Cotillard and Melvil Poupaud as siblings in their fifties, forced by the death of their parents to deal with one another years after they have fallen out.
Wild Bunch will also arrive with Dario Argento’s Dark Glasses, starring Ilenia Pastorelli as a woman seeking revenge on a serial killer who has blinded her and wiped out the family of a ten-year-old boy. Shining Sex will gather five shorts directed by Lucile Hadžihalilović, Sion Sono, Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani, Bertrand Mandico, and Kleber Mendonça Filho. According to Goodfellow, the stories “range from a young man who falls in love with a mermaid to lovers who abandon themselves to sensual pleasure in a dance hall in Brazil.” Wild Bunch has already taken the French rights to Arnaud des Pallières’s Party of Fools, which is set in nineteenth-century Paris. The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital housed an asylum for mentally ill women, many of whom were held there against their will, but Léa Seydoux will play a woman who checks in voluntarily in order to find and liberate her mother. The cast will also feature Charlotte Rampling and Cecile de France.


In other news of projects in the works, Todd Haynes—whose first documentary, The Velvet Underground, will premiere in Cannes out of competition—is preparing to shoot May December next year. Natalie Portman plays a Hollywood star who travels to Maine to meet the individual her next role is based on, a woman who sparked a tabloid scandal two decades ago when she married a man who was twenty-three years her junior. She’s played by Julianne Moore, who has worked with Haynes on Safe (1995), Far from Heaven (2002), and Wonderstruck (2017). Also lined up for Haynes is Fever, a biopic based on the life of Peggy Lee with Michelle Williams, who is also set to star in Kelly Reichardt’s Showing Up. Williams plays an artist who harnesses the chaos of her life to create new work for an upcoming exhibition. Deadline’s Justin Kroll reports that Hong Chau, Judd Hirsch, Maryann Plunkett, John Magaro, André Benjamin, Heather Lawless, Amanda Plummer, Larry Fessenden, and James Le Gros have joined the cast.


Todd Solondz hasn’t made a feature since Wiener-Dog (2016), but yesterday he announced that Love Child will be his “first movie with a plot and my first movie taking place in Texas. It’s fun and it’s sexy and it’s shaped by the Hollywood movies that made me want to become a filmmaker.” The story of a boy who aims to get rid of his father so that he can have his mother all to himself, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Colin Farrell, who were last seen together in Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Lobster (2015). Lanthimos, in the meantime, is planning to shoot Poor Things later this year. It’s an adaptation of Alasdair Gray’s 1992 novel about a scientist in nineteenth-century Glasgow who saves the life of a young woman by replacing her brain with that of her unborn child. The cast is led by Emma Stone and has recently expanded to include Willem Dafoe, Mark Ruffalo, Ramy Youssef, and Jerrod Carmichael.


In other casting news, it seems that Taylor Swift has joined Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, John David Washington, Rami Malek, Zoe Saldana, Mike Myers, Michael Shannon, Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Rock, Andrea Riseborough, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Robert De Niro in David O. Russell’s first feature since Joy (2015). It doesn’t have a title yet, and next to nothing is known about the story, but it certainly does have a cast.


Call Me by Your Name director Luca Guadagnino has added Michael Stuhlbarg, André Holland, Jessica Harper, Chloë Sevigny, Francesca Scorsese, and director David Gordon Green to the cast of Bones and All, which already features Timothée Chalamet, Taylor Russell, and Mark Rylance. Chalamet and Russell play troubled lovers on a thousand-mile journey through Reagan’s America in Guadagnino’s first feature to be shot in the U.S.


Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley, Judith Ivey, Sheila McCarthy, Michelle McLeod, and Ben Whishaw are joining Frances McDormand in Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Women Talking, Miriam Toews’s 2018 novel based on a real-life series of crimes, in which the women living in a Mennonite colony in Bolivia were raped by men from their own community. Reviewing Women Talking for the New York Times, Jennifer Reese called it “a wry, freewheeling novel of ideas that touches on the nature of evil, questions of free will, collective responsibility, cultural determinism and, above all, forgiveness. As Agata Friesen, an unflappable matriarch, puts it: ‘Let’s talk about our sadness after we have nailed down our plan.’”


The romantic comedy She Came to Me will be Rebecca Miller’s first fictional feature since Maggie’s Plan (2015). Set in New York, the film, which interweaves three love stories, will star Anne Hathaway, Tahar Rahim, Marisa Tomei, Joanna Kulig, and Matthew Broderick.


Yesterday we announced our September release of Gina Prince-Bythewood’s debut feature, Love &amp; Basketball (2000). Her most recent film, The Old Guard (2020), is the sixth most-watched movie on Netflix, and currently in the works is Exoplanet, a sci-fi thriller based on a story by Minnie Schedeen. “The logline is being kept under wraps,” reports Deadline’s Anthony D’Alessandro.


Covering the Berlinale this year, we never got around to Maria Schrader’s competing feature I’m Your Man, which is a shame, because it’s a smartly told story about loneliness featuring intricately rendered performances by Dan Stevens and Maren Eggert, who won a Silver Bear for her efforts. Schrader is now working on She Said, a drama based on a book by New York Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor about breaking the Harvey Weinstein story. Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan are in talks to take the lead roles.


Fifteen years after Sideways, Alexander Payne and Paul Giamatti will work together again on The Holdovers. Giamatti will play what Payne calls a “curmudgeonly walleyed disliked history teacher” at a prep school, where he supervises the boys with nowhere to go over the Christmas holidays in 1970. After a few days, the only three people left as the snow piles up outside are Giamatti’s teacher; one student, “a real smart-ass troublemaker who’s fifteen years old and a good kid underneath”; and a cook who has lost her son in Vietnam.


Animator and director Sylvain Chomet, whose The Triplets of Belleville (2003) was nominated for two Oscars and who turned an unproduced screenplay by Jacques Tati into The Illusionist (2010), is working on The Magnificent Life of Marcel Pagnol, a biopic based on the life of the novelist, playwright, and filmmaker best known for Marius (1931), Fanny (1932), and César (1936). Pagnol’s Marseille Trilogy “represents almost a kind of founding myth from which a sizable chunk of modern French identity has been derived,” writes Michael Atkinson in the essay included in our box set.

                    <span>⌛ Background 
Everybody in Berlin has stories when it comes to flat-hunting. It involves weird characters, strange situations. Those stories are comedic in nature, but they also tell a lot about the difficult housing market here.

Having heard a lot of them over the years, I decided to turn them into a game. 🙌

👤Who is behind this
I&#x27;m the one behind the original idea, concept and writing. This is because since 10 years, I&#x27;m also a blogger with settle-in-berlin.com. I help newcomers move to Germany/Berlin with guides on how to beat local bureaucracy. (read more about me here)

I was helped by my brother, who is a game designer. He did all the coding.
We hired pixel artists for some of the art, and did the rest ourselves.

📣What&#x27;s the point/message?
With rent prices nearly doubling since 2011, flat-hunting in Berlin has become increasingly competitive and depressing. I wanted to create a catharsis for people to have fun with our common frustration.

I also wanted to pointed out some hard truths like the fact that people with foreign-sounding names have less chances to get a flat than people with German names. I also wanted to talk about choices made by the city that really impacted negatively the housing market for tenants.

💡Inspiration
Apart from the obvious arcade titles:
- Secret of Monkey Island&#x27;s swordfighting
- Toggle.io&#x27;s @Unicorn Startup Simulator

Have fun with it and tell me what your score is! 🏆

                    <span>Posted by Candice Schumann and Susanna Ricco, Software Engineers, Google Research 
In 2016, we introduced Open Images, a collaborative release of ~9 million images annotated with image labels spanning thousands of object categories and bounding box annotations for 600 classes. Since then, we have made several updates, including the release of crowdsourced data to the Open Images Extended collection to improve diversity of object annotations. While the labels provided with these datasets were expansive, they did not focus on sensitive attributes for people, which are critically important for many machine learning (ML) fairness tasks, such as fairness evaluations and bias mitigation. In fact, finding datasets that include thorough labeling of such sensitive attributes is difficult, particula…</span>

Final Chapter
Epilogue
Before the darkness was the darkness, the darkness was a child. This child found
themselves lost and without purpose. Life was scary. Things were changing
constantly, and they found themselves at a loss. One day they were walking about
the etherial network and stumbled across a meeting house.
The child looked inside and was confused. There were hundereds of rooms with
even more people inside. There were rooms on every topic. There was a shower of
culture and an outpouring of knowledge. Hanging out here would permanently
change the course of the child&#x27;s life.
Horrified by the room takeover golem, the remaining regulars had fled their
former homes. This was not a home for legal reasons, but it was their social
home on the etherial network. Sadness had turned t…</span>

                    <span>James Benning’s Ten Skies (2004)    		
Tomorrow, June 16, Acropolis Cinema in Los Angeles will project a 16 mm print of James Benning’s Ten Skies (2004), a series of ten ten-minute static shots of the sky. Benning will be in attendance, and the event will be the first of three evenings launching Erika Balsom’s Ten Skies, a book on the film that both Adrian Martin and Jonathan Rosenbaum call a “tour de force.” On Friday, the book’s publisher, Fireflies Press, and Melbourne’s ACMI (formally known as the Australian Centre for the Moving Image) will open a series of Benning’s films with a screening of Ten Skies, and Light Industry will present the film in New York on July 1.
Many of the films that Benning has made in the past twenty-plus years, such as 13 Lakes (2004) and RR (2007)—a series of shots that begin with a train entering the frame and end when the train leaves it—invite the mind not only to contemplate his subjects’ subtle transformations but also, given the duration of each shot, to wander. Over the course of the ten chapters in Ten Skies, one for each sky, Balsom offers a possible—and richly rewarding—path. The first sky has her thinking about a sequence in Jean-Luc Godard’s Passion (1982), and the second has her revisiting Walter Benjamin’s 1936 essay “The Storyteller.”


It’s also in the second chapter that Balsom places Ten Skies within the context of Benning’s oeuvre. “From his earliest works in the 1970s, Benning has explored histories of settlement, the problem of political community, and the various ways that human actions mark the land in the United States,” she writes. “Probe his entirely sui generis filmography and you will find personal chronicles, travelogues, clever jokes, accounts of murder, indictments of whiteness, and an attention to the particularities of the Midwest. We are, in other words, a very long way from formalism. The films Benning made in the decade leading up to Ten Skies show a growing interest in duration and partake of an increasingly pared-down vocabulary, but alongside this formal perspicacity is an enduring commitment to political content.”


When the Berlinale Forum screened Ten Skies in 2005, Benning said that he was thinking of “my landscape works now as anti-war artworks—they’re about the antithesis of war, the kind of beauty we’re destroying. The Ten Skies works came about because I’m thinking about what the opposite of war is.” From Balsom, we learn that Benning put quite a lot of work into the film, more, he tells her, than went into RR. Nine months were spent finding the right swath of sky at the right moment and at the right angle that would capture the full dramatic range of each sky. Many will be surprised to learn that, for his soundtrack, Benning constructed “an elaborate audio fiction” drawn from the ambient soundscapes of different environments, and sometimes, even from the soundtracks of his own previous films.


In the third chapter, which you can read in full at the Notebook, Balsom considers what writing—as opposed to, for example, an audiovisual essay—can reveal and illuminate about a film. Ten Skies is the second book in a series that Fireflies is calling Decadent Editions, which was launched earlier this year with Goodbye, Dragon Inn, Nick Pinkerton’s book on Tsai Ming-liang’s 2003 film. There will be ten books in all, each one addressing a film from each year of the 2000s.


From 2014 through 2018, Fireflies published a magazine with each smartly designed issue—six in all—gathering essays, artwork, poetry, and assorted notes on the work of two filmmakers. The first issue paired Pier Paolo Pasolini with Apichatpong Weerasethakul, a filmmaker with whom Giovanni Marchini Camia, who cofounded Fireflies with Annabel Brady-Brown, has only become more engaged. Marchini Camia spent about two months late in 2019 on the set of Memoria, the first feature Apichatpong has shot outside of his native Thailand. Set in Bogotá, Colombia, Memoria stars Tilda Swinton as a Scottish woman who meets a French archaeologist overseeing a construction project. At night, loud banging noises keep her from getting any sleep.


Marchini Camia kept a diary, and Film Comment ran a few brief excerpts early last year. Now the full diary, along with Apichatpong’s own notes, photos, correspondence, and storyboards as well as pages from the shooting script and an interview with Swinton are gathered in Fireflies’ most ambitious project yet, a cloth-bound, hardcover volume entitled simply Memoria. The book is due in September but those who preorder it now can receive it next month, just after Apichatpong’s Memoria premieres in competition in Cannes.

                    <span>Clarkson&#x27;s Farm 居然是我对现代机械化农业第一个入门的片子。乱写一些


兰博基尼的拖拉机真是 nb。40个前进档，40个后退档

第一集没太明白，为啥必须一定先耕地再播种？直接雇佣另外一个人跟着耕过的地马上播种不就行了么

下雨的时候应该也能耕地吧。国内很多种水稻的田都是蓄水后再耕地。据长辈们说比旱地更容易。可能是怕拖拉机陷进泥浆？

拖拉机耕田弯弯曲曲的问题，应该可以通过LIDAR +　SLAM 解决？四轴无人机来个小区域精确导航？

那个 S 形状来回耕田的确不好调头，但是为什么不走 回 字形状画圆圈呢？

无人驾驶拖拉机耕田是不是下一个趋势？

那个公羊的 ball 是真的大！平均30-40cm 我日

把母羊搞怀孕还打个标记。。。这脑洞发明啊。。

那个很辣很贵的 wasabi，查了下，本来是 山葵，被误翻译成 芥末 了。。。

感觉如果有一个 app 能够根据输入的参数，预估完成剩下的任务所需要的时间和最优解就好了。。特别是需要根据不规则面积做计算的

农业真是看天吃饭。土豆收上来说变质就变质。。。

                    <span>Chess can serve as an apt metaphor for other areas of our lives, especially business. That’s because the game is a microcosm of the ways we use strategic thinking. There are not many areas where we can quickly assess the quality of our decisions and whether they are likely to have the desired effects. Chess […]

                    <span>Ned Beatty    		
From 1972 to 2013, the affable face of Ned Beatty, who has passed away at the age of eighty-three, seemed to be everywhere. A welcome presence with whom audiences connected immediately, the actor appeared in more than 160 films and television movies and episodes throughout his career. As word spread on Sunday that he was gone (accompanied by clips, quotes, and images), two of his performances emerged as cultural milestones.
One of those performances is Beatty’s first in a feature film. Born and raised in Kentucky, he’d been acting in theater for more than fifteen years when he landed the role of Bobby Trippe, one of four suburban business types who decide to canoe down a river winding through the wilderness of northern Georgia in Deliverance (1972). During an encounter deep in the woods with two mountain men, Billy is forced at gunpoint to strip and “squeal like a pig” before one of the hillbillies rapes him. “Decades later,” wrote Tim Grierson in Mel last year, “we still cannot tolerate the image of Bobby, helpless and scared, being raped. And so, we try to nullify its impact through parodies, pop-culture references, and funny T-shirts. Turns out, though, none of that works. Watch Deliverance now and ‘that scene’ retains all its horror and power. The characters don’t want to talk about it, and neither do we. That’s why it still haunts all of us.”


In a 1989 opinion piece for the New York Times, Beatty noted that he couldn’t count the times he’d been told to “squeal like a pig” by complete strangers. “I suppose when someone (invariably a man) shouts this at me I am supposed to duck my head and look embarrassed at being recognized as the actor who suffered this ignominy,” he wrote. “But I feel only pride about being a part of this story, which the director John Boorman turned into a film classic. I think Bill McKinney (who portrayed the attacker) and I played the ‘rape’ scene about as well as it could be played. It was my first film, and my best.”


Beatty’s Arthur Jensen, chairman of the Communications Corporation of America (CCA) in screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky and director Sidney Lumet’s Network (1976), has been the other performance most cited on social media since Sunday. Beatty appears for all of six minutes, but his delivery of an entire Weltanschauung in a single monologue scored him his only Oscar nomination.


In the scene, Arthur Jensen summons Howard Beale (Peter Finch), a television news anchor who has gone off script and publicly railed against one of CCA’s impending deals, into a dark and cavernous conference room. From one end of the seemingly mile-long conference table, Jenson bellows at Beale at the other. “You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples,” he thunders. “There are no nations. There are no peoples . . . There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&amp;T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.” Beatty then cuts the prophet-of-doom tone to more quietly and intimately savor the harsh truth he’s revealing. “The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has been since man crawled out of the slime.”


For Variety’s Owen Gleiberman, “the beauty of Beatty’s performance is that he’s like a banker singing an aria. It’s an ecstatic piece of over-the-top acting in which Beatty seems to be making up what he’s saying on the spot, because that’s how much he means it.” But the Beatty performance that “means the most” to Gleiberman is his Del in Robert Altman’s Nashville (1975). Del is “the hustling lawyer husband of Lily Tomlin’s gospel singer, and Beatty makes him at once glad-handing and slow-moving—a get-along guy with prying sly eyes and a hunger that won’t speak its name. At home, they have two deaf children, and Del has never even bothered to learn sign language; in the scene where his kids are trying to speak to him, Beatty makes that dereliction casually heartbreaking.”


The following year, Beatty played a hit man in Elaine May’s Mikey and Nicky (1976). “Cinema is full of colorful hit men,” writes Nathan Rabin in the essay that accompanies our release, “but Beatty and May upend expectations by crafting a portrayal that bears no trace of the pyrotechnics of his Network performance, making his gunman as unremarkable as possible. He’s just an ordinary guy with an unusual occupation, who goes about his deadly business with a grudging sense of obligation no different, really, from that of an insurance salesman eager to make his quota.” Roderick Heath finds that the role “deftly exploits Beatty’s excellence at playing superficially bland characters harboring hidden strata of weirdness, sharpened to a wicked point when the man’s true nature emerges in the climax.”


The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw suggests Beatty’s performances over the following decades “accumulated into an ambiguous image: the folksy good guy or the compromised bad guy, his characters blandly accustomed to the minor privileges of power and authority that they have built up over the years. Beatty superbly put all this into one of his greatest late roles: his voiceover for the creepy Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear in Pixar’s animation Toy Story 3 (2010), who seems like a kindly grandpa toy at the day center where Woody and the gang find themselves—but is in fact a psychopathic prison gang leader.”


In an appreciation for the Chiseler, Jim Knipfel nails the threat underlying Beatty’s affability. “He may have played his share of military figures, cops, political hacks, religious hucksters, office managers, and salesmen,” writes Knipfel, and “he may have been in everything from intense dramas and black comedies to superhero, horror, and family films, but at heart he’s usually the same old Ned Beatty, an amiable, easygoing schmo.” Knipfel pictures Beatty at a backyard barbecue, where he “would have no problem keeping the conversation rolling, dropping in the occasional ‘Boy, this corn sure is somethin’ special, ain’t it?’ for good measure. Of course at some point during the afternoon, after getting you alone in the garage under the pretext of seeing your new fishing rod, he’d make it perfectly clear (in those very same tones) why it would be in your own best interest as well as those of your family that you make the delivery by midnight or the deal was off. That was to be expected, though, even before you invited him over.”

                    <span>Using Paper for Everyday Tasks
I have a bit of a reputation of being a very techno-savvy person. People have
had the assumption that I have some kind of superpowerful handcrafted task
management system that rivals all other systems and fully integrates with
everything on my desktop. I don&#x27;t. I use paper to keep track of my day to day
tasks. Offline, handwritten paper. I have a big stack of little notebooks and I
go through them one each month. Today I&#x27;m going to discuss the core ideas of my
task management toolchain and walk you through how I use paper to help me get
things done.
I have tried a lot of things before I got to this point. I&#x27;ve used nothing,
Emacs&#x27; Org mode, Jira, GitHub issues and a few reminder apps. They all haven&#x27;t
quite cut it for me.
The natural place to start from is do…</span>

                    <span>A recent LinkedIn post tried to illustrate in graphic form some old bunk that had been debunked to death decades ago: the purported inferiority of relational relative to directed graph database management. The plethora of &quot;Great viewpoint!&quot;, &quot;great representation&quot;, &quot;love this!&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, &quot;Nice!, &quot;Very clever!&quot; reactions it triggered confirm the lack of foundation knowledge and familiarity with history of the field in the industry, without which there cannot be any progress. I will not waste any time debunking it. Instead, I will use a quote by a participant in the exchange from a Date and Darwen (D&amp;D) book to bring up an important insight by David McGoveran.

“Overall, we believe the most appropriate design will emerge if careful consideration is given to the distinction between (a) declarative sentences in natural language, on the one hand, and (b) the vocabulary used in the construction of such sentences on the other. As we showed in Chapter 2 (but simplifying slightly here), it is unencapsulated tuples in relations that stand for those sentences, and it is encapsulated domain values in attributes in those tuples that stand for particular elements — typically nouns — in that vocabulary. To say it slightly differently (and to repeat what we said in Chapter 2, albeit in different words): Domains, or types, give us values that represent things we might wish to make statements about; relations give us ways of making those statements. Consider once again the EMP relvar of Design R. Suppose that relvar includes the tuple:
TUPLE {EMP# &#x27;E7&#x27;,ENAME &#x27;Amy&#x27;,DEPT# &#x27;D5&#x27;,SALARY MONEY(60000)}
The existence of this tuple in the relvar means, by definition, that the database includes something that assert  that the following declarative sentence (statement) is true:
Employee E7, named Amy, is assigned to department D5 and earns a salary of $60,000.&quot;</span>

    Anna Vaňková in Alfréd Radok’s Distant Journey (1949)    		
The week began with lineup announcements from Critics’ Week and Directors’ Fortnight, followed by the launch of summer editions of Tribeca and Berlin. Now it’s closing out with a flurry of more festival news. Cannes has added nine features to its official selection, including Gaspar Noé’s Vortex, a love story starring Dario Argento and Françoise Lebrun; Ari Folman’s animated Where is Anne Frank?, a tribute to his parents, who were deported to Auschwitz on the same day as Anne Frank; Mi iubita, Mon amour, the first feature directed by Noémie Merlant, who costarred with Adèle Haenel in Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire; and Andrew Muscato’s New Worlds: The Cradle of a Civilization, a concert movie starring Bill Murray.
Jane Campion’s The Power of the Dog, based on Thomas Savage’s 1967 novel, is set to premiere in Venice. Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons play brothers, wealthy ranchers in 1920s Montana, who fall out over a widow played by Kirsten Dunst. While Venice is months away, Film at Lincoln Center’s Big Screen Summer starts today. Over the next eleven weeks, thirty-three selections from last fall’s New York Film Festival will be screened indoors, and on the Film Comment Podcast, hosts Devika Girish and Clinton Krute discuss a good number of them with FLC programmer Dan Sullivan and curator and critic Steve Macfarlane.


This week’s highlights:



A new 4K restoration of Alfréd Radok’s Distant Journey (1949) opens at New York’s Film Forum today. The Czech director’s debut feature tells the story of a Jewish doctor who, at the onset of the Second World War, marries a gentile in an attempt to stave off deportation to Theresienstadt, a way station to the extermination camps. Writing in Tablet about the lessons in style that Radok drew from Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941), J. Hoberman calls Distant Journey “a masterpiece of Czech cinema. It was also one of the first and remains among the strongest, most original, and most influential movies to deal with the murder of European Jewry.”




Another new 4K restoration, Ousmane Sembène’s Mandabi (1968), arrives in the UK and opens at BAM Film in New York today. Sembène “saw cinema as an engine of transformation, a ‘night school’ for the exploited masses of the African continent,” writes Chrystel Oloukoï in a guide to the Senegalese filmmaker’s work for Sight &amp; Sound. For Kaleem Aftab, also writing for the magazine, Mandabi, Sembène’s second feature after Black Girl (1966), is “the film that marks out the themes of his career: his anti-capitalist, anti-religious concerns, and his clear-sighted probing of issues of class.” But it’s also, argues the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw, “gentle, walking-pace cinema that leads us by the hand from vignette to vignette, from scene to scene, presented to us with ingenuous simplicity and calm.”




The first season of MUBI’s new podcast delves into the stories behind films that were huge in their home countries but little known elsewhere. The first episode examines the cultural impact of Paul Verhoeven’s Turkish Delight (1973) on Dutch counterculture, and the second episode examines the creation and legacy of Aditya Chopra’s Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, one of biggest hits in Bollywood history. On a related note, novelist Karan Mahajan explains in an engaging piece for the New York Review of Books why a brief flourishing of directorial freedom in India may already be wilting.




The release of In the Heights has contributors to the Guardian revisiting their favorite musicals. Guy Lodge goes for New York, New York (1977), “one of Scorsese’s greatest and gutsiest” films, while Benjamin Lee stumps for Mel Stuart’s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), with its storyline resembling “a chillingly casual slasher movie but for annoying children.” But Pamela Hutchinson’s case for Mervyn LeRoy’s Gold Diggers of 1933 is hard to beat: “This is a bona fide pre-Code musical, so the talkie scenes burst with prohibition-busting backstage antics and a little Park Avenue farce, but the curtains open wide on four of the most outlandish numbers ever filmed . . . what deadpan Ned Sparks calls: ‘The gay side, the hard-boiled side, the cynical and funny side of the Depression!’” Meantime, at the A.V. Club, A. A. Dowd, Katie Rife, and Caroline Siede discuss “the evolution and appeal of the twenty-first-century movie musical.”




Let’s head into the weekend with a bundle of new issues, including the very first from Animus, the film journal Elena Lazic launched just yesterday. The centerpiece of the new Film Quarterly is a special focus on Steve McQueen’s Small Axe, and the latest Offscreen addresses notions of modernity. “Solidarity” is the theme of the new NECSUS, while in the fifth issue of World Records, scholars and filmmakers respond to Alexandra Juhasz and Alisa Lebow’s argument that “there is an overemphasis on story” in contemporary documentaries. Journals can be for watching as well as for reading. Tecmerin: Journal of Audiovisual Essays goes international with its seventh issue, and Open Screens presents Max Tohline’s feature-length “Supercut of Supercuts,” in which he argues that “the supercut was never just a subset of remix, compilation, or fan culture, but was instead a material expression of a new historical mode of knowledge and power: the database episteme.”

Disciplines in the natural sciences, social sciences, and medicine all have to grapple with how to evaluate and compare results within the context of the continually changing real world. In contrast, a significant body of machine learning (ML) research uses a different method that relies on the assumption of a fixed world: measure the performance of a baseline model on fixed data sets, then build a new model aimed at improving on the baseline, and evaluate its performance (on the same fixed data) by comparing its performance to the baseline.  
Research into robotics systems and their applications to the real world requires a rethinking of this experiment design. Even in controlled robotic lab environments, it is pos…</span>

Representation learning is a machine learning (ML) method that trains a model to identify salient features that can be applied to a variety of downstream tasks, ranging from natural language processing (e.g., BERT and ALBERT) to image analysis and classification (e.g., Inception layers and SimCLR). Last year, we introduced a benchmark for comparing speech representations and a new, generally-useful speech representation model (TRILL). TRILL is based on temporal proximity, and tries to map speech that occurs close together in time to a lower-dimensional embedding that captures temporal proximity in the embedding space. Since its release, the research community has used TRILL on…</span>

                    <span>Alice Diop’s We (2021)
   		
On sixteen outdoor screens located throughout the city, the Berlinale is now presenting all the films it streamed to the press and industry back in March. This includes all the award winners, starting with Radu Jude’s outrageously of-the-moment Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, which took the Golden Bear; all the critical favorites, such as Alexandre Koberidze’s subtly magical What Do We See When We Look at the Sky?; all the promising young German filmmakers, such as Jonas Bak, whose Wood and Water went on to screen at New Directors/New Films in May; and all the winners of the latest round of awards announced over the past few days.
Belarusian-American writer, actor, and director Dasha Nekrasova’s The Scary of Sixty-First—the story of two young women who score a suspiciously affordable apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side only to discover that it’s haunted by the spirit of its previous owner, Jeffrey Epstein!—has won the GWFF Best First Feature Award. Reviewing this “brash, gutsy, morbidly funny” directorial debut for Variety, Guy Lodge notes that “underpinning the edgelord provocations and cheerfully cheap B-movie stylings of Nekrasova’s film is a dark, roiling rage that’s no joke: As a reflection on the abuse that powerful men mete out without due consequence, it’s without filter or apology.”


Alice Diop’s We (Nous), a personal journey along the RER B, an urban train line that runs from the northern to the southern outskirts of Paris, won the award for best film in the new Encounters program in March. It’s now taken the Berlinale Documentary Award as well. “A documentary filmmaker who has explored French societal dynamics and life in the banlieue where she grew up in three features and two short films,” writes Caitlin Quinlan at the top of her interview with the director for Reverse Shot, “Diop offers a particular insight into communities familiar to her and, in placing her own history in front of the camera, firmly declares herself a proud member of the ‘nous.’”


The documentary jury has given a special mention to Avi Mograbi’s The First 54 Years – An Abbreviated Manual for Military Occupation, which brings us to a bountiful collection of summer reading. Mograbi’s ninth feature, which gathers statements from Israeli soldiers stationed in the the Palestinian Territories in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, premiered in the Forum, a program established fifty years ago to stand “between the barricades and the ivory tower,” as the title of one book puts it.


The Forum has always provided excellent supplementary material on the films it screens each year. A little over a week ago, the program’s organizers relaunched the site, opening up vistas of clean, white space for new writing, such as Ela Bittencourt’s essay on The First 54 Years. “An Israeli subject himself,” she writes, “embedded in his culture and home town of Tel Aviv (though he’s also lived in New York), Mograbi engages Arab friends and Palestinian citizens to abolish the idea of a historical record as one predicated on a unison voice, or vision. Mograbi’s films are always asking, ‘Whose history, for and without whom?,’ pointing us back to the often revisionist nature and utilitarian usage of historical figures and events.”


Today it was announced that Shengze Zhu’s A River Runs, Turns, Erases, Replaces has won the Caligari Film Prize. On the film’s page, we find links to James Lattimer’s audio interview with Zhu, a statement from the director on the film’s relationship to her hometown, Wuhan, and an essay by Elena Meilicke, in which she writes that “Zhu allows voices that are otherwise marginalized in the Chinese media landscape to surface, and she does it . . . in a way that hybridizes the images, rendering them visible as a break or tear in the cinematic form; tellingly, those are exactly the places where the pandemic finds entry into the film.”


You have to do a little fishing to find these essays. On the front page of the new site, there’s a section labeled “Magazine,” which might be a good place in which to spotlight some of this writing. But if you poke around, you’ll find two pieces—one by Jochen Becker, the other by Bert Rebhandl—on Vincent Meessen’s Just a Movement, a documentary that approaches Jean-Luc Godard’s La chinoise (1967) from an array of disparate angles. There’s material on nearly every film in the program, and it isn’t always presented in the form of a written essay. For The Inheritance, for example, the Forum team has put together a playlist of spoken word albums that appear in Ephraim Asili’s first feature.


In a deeply considered piece unrelated to any one specific film, Cristina Nord, who took over the leadership of the Forum in 2019, writes about current debates throughout film culture sparked by the challenges of the present moment. She never uses the word “quotas,” but she does counter those who argue that calls for greater and more diverse representation throughout the industry threaten the autonomy of artists and the art they make. “There is a certain irony here,” she writes, “that the need to hold on to the known is being projected onto a medium that is totally inconceivable without movement and without the ability to unfold over time.”


The Berlinale summer special, in the meantime, runs through June 20, when two audience awards, one for a film in the main competition and the other for a title premiering in the Panorama program, will be presented live, on stage, and of course, outdoors.

    						Perhaps it is because of the ethos of worshipping of Buddhism in the southern Fujian area where I live, or it may be due to a certain destiny, when I go out to photograph, I seem to have been able to meet Buddhas all the time in the past few years. Especially when I organize my own photos, I can more and more feel that the Buddha is everywhere in various forms and shows itself at random. 

The year before last, Xiamen held the International Buddhist Supplies Exhibition. The square of the Convention Centre was magically lined with statues of Buddha waiting to be loaded and unloaded. I stood in the strong wind and waited until midnight, just to see…</span>

                    <span>Anthony Ramos and Melissa Barrera in Jon M. Chu’s In the Heights (2021)    		
Fandango recently surveyed more than 1,300 moviegoers, and ninety-six percent of them said that the first movie they plan to see now that theaters are opening up again is In the Heights, the big-screen version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical. Nearly every critic agrees it’s the perfect choice. The opener of Tribeca’s twentieth-anniversary edition, the film is officially premiering today at outdoor theaters in all five boroughs of New York City. “Seeing this massive, guileless, heartfelt piece of Hollywood entertainment on the big screen is like coming home after a long year in exile only to find that it’s still there, and maybe even better than you remembered,” writes IndieWire’s David Ehrlich.
Directed by Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians and two Step Up movies) and starring Anthony Ramos as a Washington Heights bodega owner with big dreams, In the Heights is a kaleidoscopic portrait of a Latino community in flux and “an inspired swirl of hip-hop, Latin pop, salsa, and other musical idioms,” writes Justin Chang in the Los Angeles Times. The film’s “pleasures are often glorious, even transporting. It summons—and for the most part sustains—the kind of visual and musical energy that might help give the movies the resurgent jab-in-the-arm summer they’ve been waiting for.”


For Slate’s Dana Stevens, “the musical numbers, with few exceptions, soar in the way an in-story song has to soar to convince us that, given this situation and these characters, ‘randomly bursting into song’ is a perfectly sensible thing to do.” In the Austin Chronicle, Richard Whittaker spots nods to Busby Berkeley and Stanley Donen, noting that Chu “leans heavily into the inherent fantasy of the musical with massive dance routines, huge carnivals that spontaneously erupt, and fantastical elements that . . . speak to the golden era of Technicolor musicals. And, oh, is In the Heights vibrant and awash with color and movement.” It’s “unashamedly romantic, fearlessly thrilling, endlessly optimistic and given life and voice through sheer love of people, of place—of community.”


Tribeca’s Centerpiece presentation will be the world premiere of Steven Soderbergh’s No Sudden Move, a crime drama set in 1954 Detroit. The cast is ridiculously enticing: Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, David Harbour, Ray Liotta, Jon Hamm, Amy Seimetz, Brendan Fraser, Kieran Culkin, Noah Jupe, Craig “muMs” Grant, Julia Fox, Frankie Shaw, and Bill Duke. The closing night movie is an as-yet-untitled Dave Chapelle documentary produced and directed by Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar (American Factory).


From today through June 20, Tribeca will host in-person talks with Guillermo del Toro, Doug Liman, M. Night Shyamalan, and Gina Prince-Bythewood as well as conversations marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of Joel and Ethan Coen’s Fargo and the twentieth anniversary of The Royal Tenenbaums, for which Wes Anderson, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Anjelica Huston, and Danny Glover will be on hand. There will be television programming, immersive experiences, video games, and podcasts, but “the bedrock of what we do,” festival director Cara Cusumano tells Variety’s Andrew M. Barker, remains film. “Normally I would say we don’t program to themes, we just pick the best possible films,” says Cusumano. “But we did think very seriously this year about what the festival is going to mean for New York and for our audience, and we felt like it was really important to bring a program that is very uplifting and joyful. There’s a lot of comedy, there’s a lot of music.”

In his piece on Tribeca 2021, Atkinson, referencing philosopher Stanley Cavell, considers the differences between seeing movies in a theater and streaming them at home, and then turns to his capsule reviews.
Among the films Atkinson writes about are Noah Dixon and Ori Segev’s Poser, “a kind of All About Eve for the Phoebe Bridgers set,” Randall Okita’s “spiffy résumé B-movie and unpretentiously fun” See for Me, Levan Koguashvili’s Brighton 4th, “a tiny but near-perfect, semi-comic portrait of the low-rent Georgian enclave in Brighton Beach,” Wyatt Rockefeller’s Settlers, “a polished sci-fi drama shot entirely in Namibia,” and “a fave,” Rob Schroeder’s Ultrasound, “a dizzying puzzle you don’t quite want to solve itself.”

                    <span>I recently got asked to appear as a guest on the podcast Building with Rust to talk about our recent work on GhostCell.
I never was a guest on a podcast before, so this was very exciting and of course I said yes. :)
That episode has been released now, so you can listen to an hour of me talking about GhostCell and about PL research more generally:

Information in a written document is not only conveyed by the meaning of the words contained in it, but also by the overall document layout. Layouts are commonly used to direct the order in which the reader parses a document to enable a better understanding (e.g., with columns or paragraphs), to provide helpful summaries (e.g., with titles) or for aesthetic purposes (e.g., when displaying advertisements).  
While these design rules are easy to follow, it is difficult to explicitly define them without quickly needing to include exceptions or encountering ambiguous cases. This makes the automation of document design difficult, as any system with a hardcoded set of production rules will…</span>

                    <span>Digital Asset Mining is shorthand for “proof of work consensus validation of public blockchain infrastructure”. Thankfully we have the shorthand. But it is important to understand what digital asset mining is. Public blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, store data securely but publicly in a cooperative ecosystem that is not controlled by any company or government. […]</span>

                    <span>My Homelab Build
There are many things you can be cursed into enjoying. One of my curses is
enjoying philosophy/linguistics. This leads you into many fun conversations
about how horrible English is that can get boring after a while. One of my other,
bigger curses is that I&#x27;m a computer person. Specifically a computer person that
enjoys playing with distributed systems. This is an expensive hobby, especially
when all you really have is The Cloud™.
One thing that I do a lot is run virtual machines. Some of these stick around, a
lot of them are very ephemeral. I also like being able to get into these VMs
quickly if I want to mess around with a given distribution or OS. Normally I&#x27;d
run these on my gaming
tower, however
this makes my tower very load-bearing. I also want to play games sometimes…</span>

                    <span>Honor Swinton Byrne in Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir (2019)    		
Way back in January 2019, days before Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir premiered at Sundance, where it won a grand jury prize, A24 picked up the rights to The Souvenir Part II. Today, Directors’ Fortnight delegate general Paolo Moretti and his programming team announced that a special screening of The Souvenir, the story of a young filmmaker in 1980s London, and the world premiere of Part II will be part of the lineup for the fifty-third edition running parallel to the Cannes Film Festival from July 7 through 17.
Outside of a cameo in Luca Guadagnino’s I Am Love (2009), Honor Swinton Byrne, the daughter of Tilda Swinton and playwright John Byrne, had never appeared in a film when Hogg cast her in The Souvenir as Julie, an artist in search of her voice. Julie strikes up an ill-defined relationship with Anthony (Tom Burke), an endearingly smug older man who turns out to be a heroin addict. As A. O. Scott pointed out in the New York Times, the plot—stripped of Hogg’s assured compositions and the striking performances by Byrne, Burke, Tilda Swinton as Julie’s mother, and a small but crucial turn from Richard Ayoade—may seem “absorbing but also conventional: another chronicle of addiction and codependency, another cautionary fable of a smart woman making a foolish choice, another period drama celebrating a wilder time. It sort of is all of that, but it is also emphatically not that at all.”


In November 2019, Hogg told Rory O’Connor at the Film Stage that she was already editing Part II, whose story takes off immediately where the first film left off and through “almost to the end of the ’80s. And it’s focusing very much on Julie again.” She’s still at film school, and Part II is very much about “how her life experience is fused with her creativity.” Robert Pattinson was to set to take a leading role, but when he had to back out due to scheduling conflicts, Hogg split his character in two and cast Harris Dickinson (Beach Rats) and Charlie Heaton (Stranger Things).


Another highlight in this year’s Directors’ Fortnight lineup is Ali &amp; Ava, a love story from another outstanding British director, Clio Barnard (The Arbor, The Selfish Giant). Adeel Akhtar (Four Lions) and Claire Rushbrook (Secrets &amp; Lies) star as a landlord and a teacher brought together by a young girl. Jonas Carpignano (Mediterranea, A Ciambra) will bring A Chiara, the story of a teenager investigating the disappearance of her father. Întregalde, the seventh feature from Radu Muntean (The Paper Will Be Blue; Tuesday, After Christmas), promises to be a suspenseful tale tracking three humanitarians journeying through Romania’s Apuseni Mountains.


Films by multiple directors are scattered throughout the lineup. Alice Rohrwacher (Happy as Lazzaro), Pietro Marcello (Martin Eden), and Francesco Munzi (Black Souls) have teamed up on Futura, a documentary about how young Italians see the future. Miguel Gomes (Arabian Nights) and French documentarian Maureen Fazendeiro collaborated on Tsugua Diaries, which was shot on 16 mm. They describe their project as “a lockdown journal” but “also a fiction.” Lois Patiño (Red Moon Tide) and Matías Piñeiro (Isabella) have made a short film together, Sycorax, which is based on Shakespeare’s The Tempest,  and they’re already working on a feature, Ariel. Another highlight from the shorts program is Peter Tscherkassky’s Train Again, an homage to fellow Austrian filmmaker Kurt Kren that Stefan Grissemann describes as “a phantom ride through the engine room of the seventh art, a ceremony of the (violent) mechanics of railway vehicles and image transporters.”


This year’s edition will open with Emmanuel Carrère’s Between Two Worlds, starring Juliette Binoche as a writer who takes a job as a cleaning lady while she researches her next book. When the coworkers she’s befriended find out who she really is, things do not go smoothly. Rachel Lang’s Our Men, which centers on the friendship between two military wives in Corsica, will close out the festival.


We should mention that the French Association for the Distribution of Independent Film (ACID) also unveiled a lineup this morning. The twenty-ninth edition, running parallel to Cannes, Critics’ Week, and the Directors’ Fortnight, will present five works of fiction and four documentaries, all of them currently seeking distribution. Among the filmmakers who have in the past presented their first works in the ACID showcase are Serge Bozon, Ursula Meier, Avi Mograbi, Yolande Moreau, Nicholás Pereda, and Claire Simon.

I&#x27;ll present two problems, each with two solutions (one in C++11 and one in C++20), which I think illustrate something interesting about &quot;concept overloading&quot; versus... other things.</span>

                    <span>Leyla Bouzid’s A Tale of Love and Desire (2021)    		
June is usually a relatively quiet month on the festival calendar, but this year it feels like spring, a season of renewal. Delayed editions of Tribeca, the Berlinale and Berlin’s Critics’ Week, and the Diagonale Festival of Austrian Film are all opening this week. Following last week’s unveiling of a very exciting, robust Cannes lineup, Directors’ Fortnight will announce its own official selection tomorrow. But the week begins with the lineup for the sixtieth-anniversary edition of Critics’ Week, the Cannes sidebar focused on promising newcomers.
Leos Carax, whose Annette will open the main competition in Cannes, premiered his first feature, Boy Meets Girl (1984), in Critics’ Week. The careers of Arnaud Desplechin, Nadav Lapid, Julia Ducournau, Justin Kurzel, Hafsia Herzi, and François Ozon have also been launched by the program, which is run by the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics. This year’s edition will open on July 7 with Robust, the first feature from Constance Meyer, who has won several awards over the past few years for her short films. Robust centers on the relationship between an aging movie star (Gérard Depardieu) and his new assistant, played by Déborah Lukumuena, the breakthrough star of Houda Benyamina’s Divines (2016). Leyla Bouzid’s A Tale of Love and Desire, the story of an eighteen-year-old French-Algerian who falls for a young Tunisian immigrant, will wrap Critics’ Week 2021 on July 15.


Other special screenings include A Radiant Girl, the first feature directed by renowned actor and singer Sandrine Kiberlain, and Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet’s Anaïs in Love, selected specifically to celebrate the program’s sixtieth anniversary. The film sets up a love triangle between characters played by Denis Podalydès, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, and Anaïs Demoustier, who, the programmers promise, “is more sensuous, liberated, and vibrant than ever, and whose playful energy is bewitching.”


Seven more first features will compete for three awards, and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, who won the Palme d’Or in 2007 for 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, will preside over the jury. In the video below, Critics’ Week artistic director Charles Tesson has a bit to say about each film in the program, long and short (and if the subtitles don’t pop up right away, click “CC”).

PAPAGO 趴趴狗，GoSafe 560WiFi，采用 NT96670 芯片+IMX415的 sony CMOS，4k


特点是每5分钟切割成一个单独的文件，为了防止每两个视频之间漏秒，所以会额外重复写入1秒的内容

现在想把一段时间的视频合并成一个存档，并且要跳过那些额外的1秒，上 ffmpeg。

首先前摇，生成需要合并的视频文件路径列表

    Bill Gunn and Seret Scott in Kathleen Collins’s Losing Ground (1982)    		
Even as we’re still processing the walloping Cannes lineup, let’s keep in mind that the Rotterdam and Full Frame festivals are running through the weekend and that Sheffield Doc/Fest opens today. To mark its fiftieth anniversary edition and the seventy-fifth anniversary of the opening of the Eye Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, the two Dutch institutions have teamed up to present Vive le cinéma!, an exhibition at the museum with an online extension featuring five new works by Jia Zhangke, Lucrecia Martel, Nanouk Leopold and Daan Emmen, Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese, and Carlos Reygadas. And from today through Sunday, Women and Film History International is sponsoring Entr’acte, a free screening series and conference exploring women’s contributions to cinema in the silent era.
This first week of June has given us quite a bit of weekend reading to catch up with:



Till They Listen: Bill Gunn Directs America, an exhibition and screening program peppered with a couple of concerts and a conversation with Ishmael Reed, opens tomorrow at Artists Space in New York. At Screen Slate, Stephanie LaCava has an utterly delightful conversation with Sam Waymon about Gunn, with whom he lived in a house with a particularly rich history—the old Ben Hecht estate! James Baldwin and Waymon’s sister, Nina Simone, were frequent guests. Waymon wrote music for Gunn’s plays Black Picture Show and Rhinestone Sharecropping as well as for the 1973 film Ganja &amp; Hess, in which he also appeared. In his appreciation of Gunn for Gagosian Quarterly, Carlos Valladares calls on Warner Bros. to release Gunn’s Stop! (1970). Artists Space will screen Ganja, Personal Problems (1980), and Kathleen Collin’s Losing Ground (1982), in which Gunn plays a painter, and Sabzian and Courtisane have pulled together two essays by Collins and two interviews with her.




In 1967, Susan Sontag argued that the relationship between the two women played by Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson in Ingmar Bergman’s Persona (1966) is “something beyond sexuality, beyond eroticism even.” Melissa Anderson, writing for Bookforum, finds that to be “a strange disavowal.” Also in the new summer issue, Blair McClendon writes about Claire Denis, who “has what feels like an increasingly rare faith in images and rhythm’s ability to hypnotize—the hypnotic state being the optimal way to engage in an art form born of flickering lights.” Dayna Tortorici looks back to the making and the long-term impact of Alek Keshishian’s Truth or Dare, which “caught Madonna at the height of her powers,” and poet Michael Robbins looks back even further, writing about second viewings of Rivette’s Céline and Julie Go Boating (1974) and Fassbinder’s Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980).




The third issue of Field Notes, Field of Vision’s online journal for nonfiction cinema, features archivist Mackenzie Lukenbill’s survey of visual art by HIV-positive artists working at the height of the AIDS epidemic. “This,” writes Lukenbill, “is the impossible dichotomy of the queer video works of the era: they exemplify a moment of boundless creativity, anger, and pure collective energy, but just as immediately became archives of death and mourning.” The new issue also offers Violet Lucca on Marilu Mallet’s Unfinished Diary (1982) and Trinh T. Minh-ha’s Surname Viet Given Name Nam (1989), Victor Guimarães on Brazilian cinema, Giovanni Vimercati on the late Cecilia Mangini, Devika Girish’s interview with Jia Zhangke, and Ashley Clark’s conversation with Matt Wolf about Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell (2008). Wolf has also been talking recently with writer Olivia Laing on FUSE, the podcast from BOMB magazine.




Tsai Ming-liang’s Days, which topped the best-of-2020 lists from Cinema Scope and Reverse Shot, will open in the U.S. on August 6. “Intimacy in Tsai’s films is an elusive possession,” writes Max Nelson in the New York Review of Books. “The desire for it, however, is constant and concrete: it stings, itches, presses, burns.” And yet to “build a private world in Tsai’s films is to realize that it can never be sealed tightly enough—it is to risk a leak, or a flood. Just as their characters hover between isolation and intimacy, so the movies themselves at once coalesce around an individual artistic sensibility and undercut it. They have come to seem like installments in a self-conscious performance about the conditions of auteur filmmaking itself.”




At ninety-two, Michael Snow is still best known for his landmark 1967 film Wavelength. In the new Brooklyn Rail, Raymond Foye has a good long talk with this “famous and neglected, celebrated and obscure” artist about the restoration of Wavelength and the reissue of Snow’s 1975 book Cover to Cover. The June issue also features Harrison Blackman on Blake Edwards’s Experiment in Terror (1962), Ella Turenne on Raoul Peck’s HBO series Exterminate All the Brutes, Daniel LoPilato on three films by Jia Zhangke, and a moving collection of tributes to the late painter, poet, performer, and electronic media and video artist Aldo Tambellini.

In recent years, self-supervised representation learning, which is used in a variety of image and video tasks, has significantly advanced due to the application of contrastive learning. These contrastive learning approaches typically teach a model to pull together the representations of a target image (a.k.a., the “anchor”) and a matching (“positive”) image in embedding space, while also pushing apart the anchor from many non-matching (“negative”) images. Because labels are assumed to be unavailable in self-supervised learning, the positive is often an augmentation of the anchor, and the negatives are chosen to be the other samples from the training minibatch. However, because of this random…</span>

Data is a foundational aspect of machine learning (ML) that can impact performance, fairness, robustness, and scalability of ML systems. Paradoxically, while building ML models is often highly prioritized,  the work related to data itself is often the least prioritized aspect. This data work can require multiple roles (such as data collectors, annotators, and ML developers) and often involves multiple teams (such as database, legal, or licensing teams) to power a data infrastructure, which adds complexity to any data-related project. As such, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), which is focused on making technology useful and usable for people, can help both to identify potential issues and to assess the impact on models wh…</span>

&quot;If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be
what it is, because everything would be what it isn&#x27;t. And contrary wise, what
is, it wouldn&#x27;t be. And what it wouldn&#x27;t be, it would. You see?&quot;

The modern cloud is a magical experience. You take a template, give it some SSH
keys and maybe some user-data and then you have a server running somewhere. This
is all powered by a tool called cloud-init. cloud-init
is the most useful in actual datacenters with proper metadata services, but what
if you aren&#x27;t in a datacenter with a metadata service?

I recommend it; it’s a fun and erudite satire — sort of a less political Gulliver’s Travels or a less bitter Jurgen.

Cannes artistic director Thierry Frémaux announced on Thursday morning that “cinema is not dead,”  and then proceeded to prove it by rolling out a full-to-bursting official selection for the festival’s seventy-fourth edition. Twenty-four films will compete for the Palme d’Or, eighteen will premiere in the Un Certain Regard program, six will screen out of competition. There will also be a round of special screenings, a midnight title, and a whole new program. Cannes Première will present ten new works from directors who have had films in competition in the past, “which means,” Frémaux tells IndieWire’s Eric Kohn, “they’ll be there without any backlash or questions about their stature.”
Frémaux and festival president Pierre Lescure promise yet more to come. We’ll soon be hearing about the closing night film and a big-budget crowd-pleaser set for a premiere on the beach, and next week, the names of the jury members serving with president Spike Lee will be revealed. Following last year’s cancellation, this comeback edition will open on July 6 with the presentation of an honorary Palme d’Or to Jodie Foster and wrap with the awards ceremony on July 17.


Before we take a quick first look at this fresh lineup, let’s note that Critics’ Week will announce its titles on Monday, followed by Directors’ Fortnight on Tuesday. That may or may not account for some of the missing names many were expecting to hear on Thursday, filmmakers who are believed to have projects at the ready: Claire Denis, for example, or Terence Davies, Joanna Hogg, Joel Coen, Jane Campion, Park Chan-wook, Terrence Malick, Lucile Hadžihalilović, and maybe even Paul Thomas Anderson.



Competition



Leos Carax’s Annette, the opening night film starring Adam Driver, Marion Cotillard, and Simon Helberg and featuring musical numbers by Sparks, is one of seven French films lined up for this year’s competition. France is the actual title of Bruno Dumont’s eleventh feature, with Léa Seydoux as a journalist whose life is upended by a car accident. The title of Jacques Audiard’s story of friends and lovers zeroes in on Paris, 13th District. In François Ozon’s Everything Went Fine, André Dussollier plays an eighty-five-year-old who asks his daughter (Sophie Marceau) to help him die.


Three of the four women with films in the competition are French. Titane, featuring Vincent Lindon, is Julia Ducournau’s long-awaited follow-up to Raw (2016). Mia Hansen-Løve’s Bergman Island, the story of a pair of American filmmakers working on projects on the Swedish island of Fårö, where Ingmar Bergman lived and worked for decades, stars Mia Wasikowska, Vicky Krieps, and Tim Roth. And demonstrators besiege a hospital in Catherine Corsini’s La fracture.


The fourth female director is Ildikó Enyedi, who won the Camera d’Or in Cannes in 1989 for My Twentieth Century. In The Story of My Wife, a sea captain (Gijs Naber) bets a friend in a café that he’ll marry the first woman who walks in. That woman is Lizzy, played by Léa Seydoux, whose third film in the competition is The French Dispatch. Wes Anderson tells three stories from the final issue of an American magazine set in a fictional city in France, and besides Seydoux, the cast features Benicio del Toro, Adrien Brody, Frances McDormand, Timothée Chalamet, Jeffrey Wright, Mathieu Amalric, Stephen Park, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Tilda Swinton. Swinton will also appear in Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Memoria as a Scottish woman traveling in Colombia, where she begins seeing and hearing things that have her questioning her own identity.


As with The French Dispatch, the inclusion of Paul Verhoeven’s Benedetta, based on Judith C. Brown’s 1986 book about a lesbian abbess in Renaissance Italy, is no surprise. But Sean Baker’s Red Rocket is. Secretly shot last fall, Red Rocket is a dark comedy about a pimp going on forty who leaves Los Angeles for his hometown in Texas to start anew—until he meets a woman in a donut shop named Strawberry. The third American film in the running is Flag Day, in which Sean Penn directs himself, Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, and Katheryn Winnick in the story of a father who turns to crime to support his daughter.


Ryusuke Hamaguchi, who won a Silver Bear in Berlin just a couple of months ago for Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, is bringing Drive My Car, an adaptation of a story by Haruki Murakami about an aging actor who bonds with his chauffeur, a twenty-year-old woman. Ahed’s Knee is Nadav Lapid’s follow-up to his 2019 Golden Bear winner, Synonyms. It’s a semiautobiographical feature about an Israeli filmmaker who aims to do all he can to salvage democracy in his country. Asghar Farhadi, who shot The Past (2013) in France and Everybody Knows (2018) in Spain, returns to Iran for A Hero, which “boasts a suspenseful plot that’s still under wraps,” according to Variety’s Elsa Keslassy.


Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s Lingui centers on a single mother in Chad who hopes to help her fifteen-year-old daughter get an illegal abortion. Nabil Ayouch’s Casablanca Beats, set at a cultural center where young people seek escape in hip hop, will be the first Moroccan film in competition since Abdelaziz Ramdani’s Âmes et rythmes in 1962. Justin Kurzel’s Nitram, based on a 1996 mass shooting in Tasmania and starring Caleb Landry Jones, is the first Australian film to compete since Julia Leigh’s Sleeping Beauty (2011).


The renowned theatrical director Kirill Serebrennikov, known to cinephiles for The Student (2016) and Leto (2018), carries on working despite periodic run-ins with Russian authorities. In Petrov’s Flu, based on a novel by Alexei Salnikov, a feverish comic book artist drifts somewhere between fantasy and reality. Juho Kuosmanen, the Finnish director best known for The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki (2016), tells the story of Laura, a student traveling from Moscow to Murmansk with a vulgar stranger, in Compartment No. 6.
 	 		 			
 				
 					 				

 			
 			 		 	 		
Joachim Trier completes his Oslo trilogy with The Worst Person in the World, in which a thirty-year-old woman believes she has finally found true love. In Belgian director Joachim Lafosse’s The Restless, a bipolar father suffers a severe relapse. And Nanni Moretti settles in with three families living in three apartments in the same building in Three Floors.

Un Certain Regard



Six of the eighteen features selected for Un Certain Regard are first films, and a good number are second directorial outings, including Bonne mère, the story of a housekeeper in Marseille from Hafsia Herzi, known for her performances in films by Abdellatif Kechiche and Bertrand Bonello. Kogonada follows up on Columbus (2017) with After Yang, in which a father and daughter cope with the breakdown of their family robot. In Eskil Vogt’s The Innocents, a group of children betray the title by revealing dark and mysterious powers. Aleksey German Jr. tells the story of a professor in Russia who takes on his city’s administration in House Arrest.



Out of Competition



Todd Haynes tackles his first documentary with The Velvet Underground, a group portrait of one of the most influential bands of the 1960s and early ’70s. Tom McCarthy directs Matt Damon as an oil worker who travels to France to clear his estranged daughter of murder charges in Stillwater. Catherine Deneuve stars as a mother whose son refuses to acknowledge his terminal illness in Emmanuelle Bercot’s In His Lifetime. Han Jae-rim’s Emergency Declaration, an action thriller about an airline disaster, stars Song Kang-ho, Jeon Do-yeon, and Lee Byung-hun.



Cannes Première



The single directorial debut in this new program is Charlotte Gainsbourg’s Jane par Charlotte, a film she made with her mother, Jane Birkin. The title echoes Agnès Varda’s 1988 collaboration with Birkin, Jane B. par Agnès V. Andrea Arnold, in the meantime, has been working for six years on a very different sort of portrait, Cow. “When I look at Luma, our cow, I see the whole world in her,” she says.


The ever-prolific Hong Sangsoo, who won a Silver Bear for best screenplay for Introduction in March, is back with In Front of Your Face. Arnaud Desplechin’s Deception is an adaptation of Philip Roth’s 1990 novel starring, once again, Léa Seydoux, as well as Denis Podalydès and Emmanuelle Devos. Kornél Mundruczó’s Evolution, inspired by György Ligeti’s Requiem, focuses on three generations of a single family. And Oliver Stone has a new documentary whose title is pretty self-explanatory: JFK Revisited: Through the Looking Glass.



Special Screenings



Jafar Panahi, Anthony Chen, Malik Vital, Laura Poitras, Dominga Sotomayor, David Lowery, and Apichatpong Weerasethakul have all contributed to the omnibus feature The Year of the Everlasting Storm, which producer and distributor Neon is calling “a love letter to cinema and its storytellers.” Karim Aïnouz describes his hybrid feature Mariner of the Mountains as an emotional inventory of his own life, beginning with the love story between his Brazilian mother and Algerian father.
 	 		 			
 				
 					 				

 			
 			 		 	 		
As he did in The Trial (2018) and State Funeral (2019), Sergei Loznitsa has drawn on archival footage to create Babi Yar. Context, a collection of short films that approach the massacres carried out in a ravine in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by the Nazis during the Second World War from a range of perspectives. It begins with Germany’s invasion of Ukraine in 1941 and conclude with a devastating mudslide in 1961.
All in all, that is a lot of films to screen in just twelve days, and we haven’t even mentioned a good dozen or so here. And again, the lineups for Critics’ Week and Directors’ Fortnight arrive early next week.

Reinforcement and imitation learning methods in robotics research can enable autonomous environmental navigation and efficient object manipulation, which in turn opens up a breadth of useful real-life applications. Previous work has demonstrated how robots that learn end-to-end using deep neural networks can reliably and safely interact with the unstructured world around us by comprehending camera observations to take actions and solve tasks. However, while end-to-end learning methods can generalize and scale for complicated robot manipulation tasks, they require hundreds of thousands real world robot training episodes, which can be difficult to obtain.

                    <span>Paula Beer in Christian Petzold’s Undine (2020)    		
On Friday, Christian Petzold’s Undine finally arrives in the U.S., well over a year after its premiere at the Berlinale, where it won an award for best film in the main competition from the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) and a Silver Bear for Paula Beer’s lead performance. In the run-up to Friday’s release, contributors to In Review Online are revisiting every feature as well as a “smattering” of television films and episodes Petzold has directed over the course of twenty-five years. The German filmmaker is “arguably contemporary cinema’s most consistent chronicler of twenty-first-century Europe, an era formed and defined by the economic, political, and social calamities of the preceding twentieth century,” writes Daniel Gorman in the introduction to the InRO retrospective. “It’s a fascinating body of work, with cold, sparse surfaces that contain a surfeit of explosive emotions—indeed, Petzold might be our last true purveyor of the melodrama.”
The centuries-old story of a water nymph who takes on human form and a lover who must never leave her—if he does, she’ll have to kill him and return to the water—is fertile ground for melodrama. Beer’s Undine is dumped in the very first scene, but before she has time to process the pain, she falls for Christoph, an underwater welder played by one of Germany’s rising stars, Franz Rogowski, who, like Beer, first worked with Petzold on Transit (2018).


Beer’s vague resemblance to Nina Hoss, the star of Petzold’s Something to Remind Me (2001), Wolfsburg (2003), Yella (2007), Jerichow (2008), Barbara (2012), and Phoenix (2014), has drawn unfavorable comparisons from a handful of critics. In the Notebook, Daniel Kasman finds that Beer “fails to have that magical something” that has given Hoss “an entrancingly independent and unpredictable singularity.” Melissa Anderson has had her reservations as well. “Besotted with Hoss, I took an irrational dislike to Beer, whom I found a wan substitute: too young, too short, incapable of ever exuding Hoss’s casual steeliness, her throaty grandeur,” she writes in 4Columns. But Anderson has come around. “Undine’s success owes largely to Beer’s talent for seamlessly inhabiting two personas—one rooted in the outré, the other in centuries of certainties and data—often at the same time.”


Undine works as a guide to a museum’s collection of three-dimensional models of Berlin depicting the city in various stages of its turbulent development: from a sooty industrial town in the nineteenth century to the capital of a fascist regime in the twentieth, then from the crushed site of loss and rubble to the focal point of the Cold War, and most recently, a hub of real estate speculation and gentrification. “I think of Berlin as a raped city architecturally,” Petzold tells Dustin Chang at ScreenAnarchy. “Every three years, someone is coming with new architecture plans.” When the wall dividing the city fell in 1989, “Berlin had the chance,” says Petzold. “We had a whole city being united, which was now in the hands of the government. It was not a private property. It was our property. We could’ve made something beautiful.” So “someone like Undine who’s been living here for centuries, with all these changes, she is like a sad witness of our changing times. So this was our idea.”
 	 		 			
 				
 					 				

 			
 			 		 	 		
Reviewing Undine for Sight &amp; Sound, Giovanni Marchini Camia observes that “the notion of imperfect regeneration emerges both as a structuring principle, in the narrative’s many doublings and déjà vus, and a recurring motif: in the keepsake diver figurine that Undine breaks and glues back together; in Christoph’s job as an industrial diver, welding a dam’s damaged underwater turbines; in the cycle of destruction and reconstruction that defines the history of Berlin.”
As J. Hoberman writes in the New York Review of Books, Undine eventually “plunges decisively into the supernatural, with accidents, acts of vengeance, vanishings, and intimations of Wuthering Heights.” Back in Sight &amp; Sound, Jonathan Romney suggests that Petzold “teasingly invites us to accept the drama as being situated between realism and fairy tale, in a zone of narrative logic akin to dream. It’s no accident that at different points Christoph and Undine doze off in broad daylight; and Petzold has claimed the eminently oneiric Vertigo as one of the film’s inspirations.” For Newcity Film’s Ray Pride, “Petzold has grown into the role of a master of the cumulative power of elegant drama—the layers of fantasy these characters create for themselves are epic but tangible—but also of the smashing payoff.”


Undine is the first in a projected trilogy of films that will transpose myths rooted in the elements to contemporary settings. He tells Dustin Chang that, after spending a week in bed with Covid last year, he ditched the dystopian screenplay he’d completed. “I’m not interested in dystopia anymore,” he says. Bed-ridden, he watched his way through an Eric Rohmer box set. “I was so impressed by Rohmer’s films, so I started writing a new story, and I am now finished with the script,” he says. In this Rohmer-inspired story, a group of young people spend the summer by the Baltic Sea. The forest catches fire, “and their desire and their hearts are also burning, and the fire in the end is out of control.” Paula Beer will star.

                    <span>Billy Wilder    		
Last month’s round on new and noteworthy books opened with early reviews of a multifaceted analysis of Alfred Hitchcock and a collection of journalistic missives written by the young Billy Wilder. And the reviews keep coming. With Billy Wilder on Assignment: Dispatches from Weimar Berlin and Interwar Vienna, editor Noah Isenberg and translator Shelley Frisch “have pieced together a sort of memoir of the artist as a young man, and, as such, a book that will own a spot on my Wilder shelf beside Ed Sikov’s unbeatable biography, On Sunset Boulevard, and Cameron Crowe’s fabulous book of interviews, Conversations with Wilder,” writes Sam Wasson, author of The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood, for Air Mail.
In his first-person reports on touring jazz bands and troupes of dancing girls, his celebrity profiles and slice-of-life sketches, “I think you can see the germs for a lot of later ideas,” Isenberg tells Donna Ferguson in the Guardian. “And beyond that, you can see a lot of what we come to expect from a Billy Wilder movie: the dramas and the comedies, all that sparkling wit, that charm, that mordant humor and sarcasm.” In Bookforum, Ryan Ruby writes that “more than any particular correspondence between a reported event and a filmed plot point, it is the ‘voice’ Wilder adopted as a reporter in Vienna and Berlin that found a home in the mouths of the unsentimental, fast-talking, image-obsessed characters that populate Double Indemnity (1944), Sunset Boulevard (1950), The Apartment (1960), and Some Like It Hot (1959).”


For Thomas Doherty, writing for Tablet, two pieces on the making of the 1930 film People on Sunday are among the “gold nuggets” in the collection. Written by Wilder, based on a story by Curt Siodmak, shot by Eugen Schüfftan, and directed by Robert Siodmak and Edgar G. Ulmer, this “lackadaisical neorealist portrait of a quartet of carefree German youth on a day off, swimming and sunbathing, flirting and quarreling, was a smack in the face to the artsy pretensions of mainstream German cinema,” writes Doherty. “Everyone chips in regardless of job description (Wilder schlepped the camera equipment and held the light reflectors), all in the service of ‘shooting a few truths we consider important, for a laughably small sum of money.’ Wilder relates the backstory with utter sincerity and boyish exuberance, without a trace of cynicism.”


Billy Wilder: Dancing on the Edge, a critical study by Joseph McBride, the author of books on Orson Welles, John Ford, and Ernst Lubitsch, will be out in October. There are, in the meantime, “several impressive, full-dress biographies of Hitchcock,” writes Glenn Frankel in the Washington Post, “but Edward White’s thoughtful and nuanced book takes a different approach.” The Twelve Lives of Alfred Hitchcock: An Anatomy of the Master of Suspense “explores the master’s life and work through a dozen different prisms that expose and illuminate his various personas. Some are obvious to any Hitchcock fan: the Murderer, the Womanizer, the Auteur, the Voyeur, the Entertainer. Others are more original: The Dandy, for example, explores Hitchcock’s fascination with fashion design for both men and women.”


In an excerpt up at Literary Hub, White addresses Hitchcock’s often inexcusable treatment of women, while in a piece for the Paris Review, White writes about the director’s “steel girder,” his wife and collaborator, Alma Reville. And Frankel has been talking to Texas Public Radio’s Nathan Cone about his new book, Shooting Midnight Cowboy: Art, Sex, Loneliness, Liberation, and the Making of a Dark Classic, which will serve as the basis for a new documentary by Nancy Buirski (The Rape of Recy Taylor).



More Updates



Wilder is not one of the ten directors David Thomson writes about in A Light in the Dark: A History of Movie Directors, but Hitchcock is. For the Arts Fuse, David D’Arcy talks with Thompson about both directors, about the story David Fincher might have told in Mank, and about why Thomson suspects that Sam Wasson’s book on the making of Chinatown doesn’t tell the whole story. At Deadline, Todd McCarthy wonders why Thomson has turned against his 1997 biography, Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood. “David is such a good writer and scholar that he could write rings about and around Howard Hawks—as he already has on numerous occasions—but not he nor I nor anyone else of whom I am aware has been able to penetrate the man’s hard-shelled heart,” writes McCarthy.


Reviewing Mark Harris’s Mike Nichols: A Life and Hermione Lee’s Tom Stoppard: A Life for the New Republic, Rachel Shteir finds that a thread running through both books is “their subject’s unknowability. Nichols is enigmatic because his life was lived in public as a famous person—the way an artist has to in order to be successful in America. Stoppard, meanwhile, seems unknowable because his work cannot be traced back to his life. It is, to quote Anton Chekhov, ‘an opening into eternity.’”


Last August, we took an early look at David Mikics’s Stanley Kubrick: American Filmmaker, and now Andrew Delbanco has written about this “sharp and sensitive” study for the New York Review of Books. Delbanco’s review serves as an excellent primer or refresher on the chronology of a career as monolithic as the black slab in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Two more recent books take measure of the filmmaker’s influence. After Kubrick: A Filmmaker’s Legacy, edited by Jeremi Szaniawski, “complements Mick Broderick’s The Kubrick Legacy, but does not reproduce it,” writes Joy McEntee in Senses of Cinema. “Broderick’s book arguably traces Kubrick’s after-life more directly than Szaniawksi’s. Indeed, Szaniawski’s avowed aim is to approach Kubrick’s legacy obliquely via his followers’ films in terms of Kubrick’s ‘tonal, stylistic and thematic/motivic impact.’”


In March, the books roundup opened with Nick Pinkerton’s Goodbye, Dragon Inn, the title that’s launched Decadent Editions, a series of ten books from Fireflies Press, each one taking on a single film from each year of the 2000s. At Electric Ghost, Pinkerton tells Patrick Preziosi that when editors Giovanni Marchini Camia and Annabel Brady-Brown approached him, “it seemed like a Kismet kind of match, because their focus on trying to create a sort of survey of relatively recent film history with the series corresponded to something that I had been quietly working away at over the last few years largely, if not exclusively, in pieces that I’d done for Film Comment, which was trying to isolate and describe phenomena that were unique to the culture of moving images in the twenty-first century. Going after these phenomena, trying to enumerate things that were genuinely new in film culture and moving image-based art.”



Two Women



In Sofia Coppola: The Politics of Visual Pleasure, Anna Backman Rogers argues that the filmmaker aims “to slyly corrode Hollywood’s patriarchal underpinnings,” writes Edward Jackson in Bright Lights Film Journal. “Whether or not this constitutes a ‘radical form of feminism’ is up for debate, especially given how embedded Coppola is in the same privilege she seeks to trouble. That said, Rogers’s main argument—that Coppola manipulates pleasurable images to unsettle rather than mollify us—is utterly convincing.”


Before she turned to writing, Goliarda Sapienza was an actress who appeared in Luchino Visconti’s Senso (1954) and in Abandoned (1955), the directorial debut of her partner, Francesco Maselli. She “helped shape the Italian film industry in its golden age,” writes Anna Momigliano in the New York Times. “She served as a muse, occasional actress, and uncredited factotum, working on casting, screenwriting, and voice-overs.” Two years after her death in 1996, her widower, Angelo Pellegrino, found a publisher for “what is now considered her masterpiece,” The Art of Joy, originally completed in 1976. In France, the 700-page novel became “a literary sensation, selling 350,000 copies and earning Sapienza comparisons to D. H. Lawrence and Stendhal.”



Two Memoirs



At thirty-nine, Seth Rogen may be a bit young to be writing a memoir, but the Washington Post’s Thomas Floyd has clearly enjoyed his “candid collection of sidesplitting essays,” Yearbook. “Rather than a check-the-boxes origin story or didactic scroll through his IMDb page,” writes Floyd, “Rogen opts for a nonlinear assortment of anecdotes that highlights his sardonic wit, knack for mischief, and find-the-humor-in-life ethos.”


In his new memoir, Brat: An ’80s Story, Andrew McCarthy, “astutely rather than arrogantly, attributes his success in St. Elmo’s Fire and Pretty in Pink to ‘an emotional availability that was difficult to mask’ and ‘a freshness, a sense of discovery, that can be captured only in passing,’” writes Ron Cerabona in the Canberra Times. “He notes this is a quality, not a skill.” McCarthy has a good long talk with Michael Schulman in the New Yorker about revisiting the Brat Pack after all these years, overcoming alcoholism, and becoming a travel writer.



Forthcoming



Little White Lies is running an excerpt from Alex Dudok de Wit’s new book on Isao Takahata’s Grave of the Fireflies (1988), one of the most moving animated features ever made, and it has us looking ahead to further titles lined up for the BFI Film Classics series. October will see the release of J. Hoberman’s study of Leo McCarey’s Marx Brothers classic, Duck Soup (1933), plus Michael Atkinson’s book on David Lynch’s Blue Velvet (1986) and more. November will see two new books on films by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, with Pam Cook taking on I Know Where I’m Going! (1945) and Ian Christie writing about A Matter of Life and Death (1946).


Tell It to the Stones: Encounters with the Films of Danièle Huillet and Jean-Marie Straub, a collection edited by Annett Busch and Tobias Hering, will be out in July. And Dana Stevens’s long and eagerly anticipated biography, Camera Man: Buster Keaton, the Dawn of Cinema, and the Invention of the Twentieth Century, now has a release date: October 26.



Endnotes



Ecstatic Static is a production company and online resource recently launched by This Long Century founder Jason Evans and producer Myriam Schroeter. While working with artists and hosting screenings, Evans and Schroeter have also put together an impressive collection of freely accessible resources, including books by and about Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Bresson, Maya Deren, and Satyajit Ray. And speaking of Ray, he would have turned 100 on May 2, and the Times of India reports that two new collections of stories written by the filmmaker have been translated and released to mark the centenary.


Scout Tafoya talks about his new book, Cinemaphagy: On the Psychedelic Classical Form of Tobe Hooper, on the Cine-Cast and tells Video Essay Podcast host Will DiGravio that he hopes readers will see Hooper “the way I see him: this was an old-school film artist, one of the best in the American cinema, and he ought to be treated like it.”


Stephen Saito talks with critic, editor, and author Matt Zoller Seitz about the online bookstore he’s set up in his garage, MZS Worldstore. “We probably sell ten times as many books of an extremely specific type as a lot of the major chain outlets would, so it’s great to be able to prolong the life of—and in some cases resuscitate—books that are thought of as dead,” says Seitz. Light Industry, the Brooklyn venue for film and electronic art, has also set up a store and invited Erika Balsom, author of the forthcoming second volume in the Decadent Editions series, Ten Skies, to spotlight ten titles. For even more recommendations, see the latest round from Christopher Schobert at the Film Stage.

                    <span>Posted by Tim Blakely, Software Engineer and Michał Januszewski, Research Scientist, Connectomics at Google 
In January 2020 we released the fly “hemibrain” connectome — an online database providing the morphological structure and synaptic connectivity of roughly half of the brain of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). This database and its supporting visualization has reframed the way that neural circuits are studied and understood in the fly brain. While the fruit fly brain is small enough to attain a relatively complete map using modern mapping techniques, the insights gained are, at best, only partially informative to understanding the most interesting object in neuroscience — the human brain.

                    <span>Raúl Ruiz’s Socialist Realism    		
In 1972, Chilean director Raúl Ruiz began work on Socialist Realism, a feature that would take a sardonic look at Popular Unity, the alliance of leftist and left-leaning parties led by socialist president Salvador Allende. On September 11 of the following year (not quite three years into the Allende administration), the military staged a coup d’état, ending a four-decade-long succession of democratically elected governments in Chile and establishing a junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet.
The coup left Ruiz little choice but to abandon Socialist Realism and flee Chile for France with his wife and close collaborator, filmmaker Valeria Sarmiento. Much of the unedited material eventually wound up being stored at Duke University in North Carolina. Now, Sarmiento, working with the Chilean production company Poetastros, has launched an international campaign to complete what Gonzalo Valdivia, writing for the Chilean daily La Tercera, calls one of Ruiz’s most ambitious and political works.


When Ruiz died in 2011, he had made well over a hundred films and was preparing to shoot Lines of Wellington, an epic war movie with a cast led by John Malkovich and including Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, and Michel Piccoli. Sarmiento took the reins, and Lines of Wellington premiered in competition in Venice before screening at the Toronto and New York film festivals. She then turned to three projects that Ruiz had begun in Chile but had never been able to complete. In 1990, when the Pinochet regime finally fell, Ruiz returned to conduct an acting workshop that led to the creation of A Wandering Soap Opera, a formally rambunctious tribute to the telenovela. Sarmiento shaped the material into an eighty-minute feature that she presented in 2017 in Locarno, where Ruiz’s debut feature, Three Sad Tigers, had won the Golden Leopard back in 1969.


Two years before that auspicious debut, Ruiz, then just twenty-seven, wrote and directed The Tango of the Widower but couldn’t raise the funds for the sound design. Half a century later, Sarmiento oversaw the restoration of the black-and-white footage and created a new audio track. In February 2020, The Tango of the Widower and Its Distorting Mirror, which centers on a professor haunted by visions of his late wife, opened the Berlinale’s Forum program and is now slated to screen in New York in July and August as part of Film at Lincoln Center’s Big Screen Summer program. “Perhaps the best way to think of The Tango of the Widower is as a reincarnation,” suggests Ela Bittencourt in Sight &amp; Sound. “Though nominally ‘co-directed,’ its process is more like a creative interference—in the best sense of the word—with an archeological find.”
 	 		 			
 				
 					 				

 			
 			 		 	 		
In Socialist Realism, a factory worker is accused of stealing tools, while off in a smoke-filled room, intellectuals debate the future of Popular Unity. “At a certain moment,” Ruiz once wrote, “these characters intersect in an apparent friendship that ends in action-packed scenes with crossing bullets and songs shouted at the top of their lungs, thus producing a satirical reading of the time.” A fifty-minute rough cut of Socialist Realism, a mere sketch, made the rounds some years ago, but Gonzalo Valdivia reports that Ruiz envisioned a final version that would run somewhere between 150 and 225 minutes.
Sarmiento and Poetastros, reteaming with Tango editor Galut Alarcón and composer Jorge Arriagada, are looking to raise around $150,000 to complete Socialist Realism fifty years after Ruiz shot it. They have applied for four separate grants from Chile’s Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Heritage, and have been rejected each time. They’re now turning to the international community of cinephiles for support. “Ruiz’s oeuvre is one of the most sprawling, singular, and influential bodies of work in all of world cinema,” writes Dennis Lim at the campaign site, “and the possibility of that body expanding to include the films that the hyper-prolific Ruiz himself was unable to complete during his lifetime is not just immensely exciting, it is a fundamentally Ruizian enterprise.”

Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
is the king of chats. It is the grandfather of nearly every chat protocol and
program you use today. It has been a foundation of the internet for over 30
years and is likely to outlive most of the chat apps you use today. IRC is used
heavily by the people that make the software that you use daily, and has been
catalytic to careers the world over.
However, because of its age IRC can be a bit hard for newcomers to get into. It
has its own cultural norms that will seem alien. In this article we&#x27;re going to
show you how to set up an IRC client and a persistent bouncer (something that
stays connected for you) with a web UI on NixOS. For the
sake of simplicity we well be connecting to Libera Chat.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Sydney, Australia, where I will continue the best job so far of my career: Performance engineering at Netflix. I&#x27;m grateful for the support of Netflix engineering management, Netflix HRBPs, and others for helping to make this happen. While my move is among the first from the Linux cloud teams, Netflix has had staff in Australia for years (for content, marketing, and the FreeBSD OCA).</span>

                    <span>Did You See This?
    Jean Vigo’s Zéro de conduite (1933)    		
Think of MGM, and you’re thinking of such classic musicals as Singin’ in the Rain (1952) and sweeping epics like Gone with the Wind (1939). But the bulk of the films the once-great Hollywood studio made before 1986 was sold to Warner Bros. decades ago. MGM still had Rocky and James Bond, but for months, it had been looking for a buyer until Amazon picked it up on Wednesday for $8.45 billion. In the New York Times, Brooks Barnes, Nicole Sperling, and Karen Weise explain why Amazon has shelled out about forty percent more for MGM than anyone else was willing to pay. “For starters, it can.” Beyond that, though, as other studios funnel their films into their own services, Amazon’s Prime Video has become desperate for titles to stream and I.P. to exploit.
In festival news, Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch has been confirmed not only for Cannes but also for the New York Film Festival in the fall before it opens in theaters on October 22. While we await next week’s announcement of the full Cannes lineup, Fabien Lemercier surveys dozens of contenders at Cineuropa. When this year’s Directors’ Fortnight opens on July 7, the Carrosse d’Or will be given to the great documentarian Frederick Wiseman. It’s something like a life achievement award presented each year by the French Directors’ Association, and past winners include Agnès Varda, Ousmane Sembène, and Martin Scorsese.


Starting on June 11, and throughout most of the summer, the NYFF will present selections from last year’s program—but this time around, in theaters. Highlights in the Big Screen Summer series include all five features in Steve McQueen’s Small Axe anthology; The Tango of the Widower and Its Distorting Mirror, a feature begun in 1967 by Raúl Ruiz and completed last year by Valeria Sarmiento; and the new restoration of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s Flowers of Shanghai (1998).


Here’s what’s caught our eye over the past seven days:



In the new Sight &amp; Sound, Richard Porton presents a quick primer on the subject of his book, Film and the Anarchist Imagination. Moving through such works as Lizzie Borden’s Born in Flames (1983) and Pedro Pinho’s The Nothing Factory (2017), he arrives midway through at Jean Vigo’s Zéro de conduite (1933). “The genius of Vigo’s film resides in the ability of its young protagonists to transform the carceral realm of the classroom into a liberatory zone more reminiscent of a playground,” writes Porton. “This deployment of play is especially apparent in a scene in which one of the more sympathetic teachers impersonates Chaplin—a heroic figure for anarchist cinephiles. The dreamy slow-motion pillow fight in the students’ dormitory, the movie’s most famous set piece, is a utopian affirmation of possibilities beyond the parameters of a repressive institution.”




Writing for Artforum five years ago, Nick Pinkerton suggested that if one were to “devise the platonic ideal of a pre-Code movie it would probably look quite a bit like Tay Garnett’s 1930 barrelhouse melodrama Her Man.” It’s a retelling of the story of doomed lovers Frankie and Johnnie starring Helen Twelvetrees and Ricardo Cortez and set in a Havana dive. A new restoration premiered at the Museum of Modern Art in 2016, and Farran Smith Nehme called it “an exhilarating discovery” in Film Comment. Now Her Man is screening in MoMA’s Virtual Cinema through June 10. “There’s an abundance of running gags,” writes J. Hoberman in the New York Times, “but what really sets Her Man apart is its fluidity. Garnett orchestrates several extended dolly shots through Havana’s red-light district—the camera navigating crowds, horse carts, and fistfights. The accompanying sound mix is no less swoon-worthy.” Her Man often plays “like one long barroom brawl.”




Marking the thirtieth anniversary of Daughters of the Dust, New York’s Metrograph is running an essay by Yasmina Price on director Julie Dash’s “constellation of influences and interlocutors.” Dash “operated in softer and more aesthetically driven registers” than other filmmakers associated with the LA Rebellion and turned to Sergei Parajanov, Andrei Tarkovsky, Isaac Julien, and Satyajit Ray “as points of reference in her image-making.” Her work was also in conversation with Black women writers such as Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, and Toni Cade Bambara. In light of her collaboration with artist Arthur Jafa as her cinematographer and painter Kerry James Marshall as her production designer, “it becomes clear how the film’s breathtaking visuals emerged from both the attentiveness to minutiae and a sweeping spatial sensibility.”




At Hyperallergic, Ryan Swen offers a guide to Jia Zhangke’s five feature-length documentaries and Jordan Cronk talks with the filmmaker about his latest, Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue (2020). Divided into eighteen chapters, Swimming draws on conversations with those who remember the late writer Ma Feng, best known for the stories he wrote in the 1950s and ’60s, and with three living writers, Jia Pingwa, Yu Hua, and Liang Hong. As Ignatiy Vishnevetsky points out at the A.V. Club, “what emerges is a fragmentary oral history of Chinese rural life across several transformative decades of the twentieth century.” Jia tells Cronk that what too often goes missing in “abstract or statistical histories” is “not necessarily what happened, but how things happened, and those are the details which I hope, once seen, will offer compelling evidence as to why we and other documentary filmmakers make the films we make.” Talking to Forrest Cardamenis at Filmmaker, Jia says that he wants his audience “to listen again and really face what we have experienced so that we will not make the same mistakes again.”




Making the same mistakes again and again is a running motif throughout Hugo Emmerzael’s engaging interview in the Notebook with Sergei Loznitsa, the director of such fictional features as My Joy (2010) and Donbass (2018) as well as several documentaries, including Austerlitz (2016), The Trial (2018), and State Funeral (2019). “The most prescient mention of crowds in literature was made by Alexander Pushkin in Boris Godunov,” says Loznitsa, referencing the play that Modest Mussorgsky turned into an opera, which in turn, was adapted for the screen in 1954 by Vera Stroyeva and in 1989 by Andrzej Żuławski. “There has been this tragic situation that involves the killing of a child. The finale depicts a large crowd that witnesses this horrific event happening on stage. In the last sentence Pushkin remarks that people are speechless. ‘The People are silent with horror.’ Starting from this remark, I think we can have a perspective on various events throughout Soviet history.”

Automatic text-to-image synthesis, in which a model is trained to generate images from text descriptions alone, is a challenging task that has recently received significant attention. Its study provides rich insights into how machine learning (ML) models capture visual attributes and relate them to text. Compared to other kinds of inputs to guide image creation, such as sketches, object masks or mouse traces (which we have highlighted in prior work), descriptive sentences are a more intuitive and flexible way to express visual concepts. Hence, a strong automatic text-to-image generation system can also be a useful tool for rapid content creation and could be applied to many other creative applicati…</span>

                    <span>Epilogue
The last caretaker&#x27;s absence rippled throughout the halls. The darkness was all
that remained.
I used to run an IRC network named PonyChat. It was an IRC network aimed at
adult fans of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Looking back, working on that
network was probably the biggest catalyst to my learning how to do system
administration to the level I am at today.
Lots of stuff goes wrong when you run an IRC network. PonyChat peaked at around
500 users on average, but that didn&#x27;t stop things from being interesting. There
were several &quot;groups&quot; of people there, and a lot of roleplaying channels. As
things like Discord picked up more and more users, a lot of the roleplaying
channels were all that were left at the end. There were some people in the #geek
room that were near permanen…</span>

                    <span>Hong Sangsoo’s Tale of Cinema (2005)    		
In 2005, Hong Sangsoo’s sixth feature, Tale of Cinema, became the second of a total of four of his films so far to premiere in competition at Cannes. Several months later, it screened at the New York Film Festival, and then returned to the States in 2012 for a one-off screening at Japan Society, but it’s never seen a proper theatrical release in the U.S. Now New York’s Metrograph is screening Tale of Cinema, albeit virtually, through Monday.
It’s a tale told in two distinct parts. In the first, Sang-won, a young student played by Lee Ki-woo, bumps into an ex-girlfriend, Young-shil (Uhm Ji-won), and after dinner and sex, they decide to kill themselves—together. Following a transition so smooth that it takes many viewers a moment or two to realize it’s happened, Dong-soo (Kim Sang-kyung), recently graduated from film school, walks out of the theater that’s just screened this story of suicidal lovers, a film that not only uncomfortably echoes a chapter in Dong-soo’s own life and stars an actress named Young-shil but has also been made by his mentor, Yi Hyongsu, an ailing director of some renown.


In her 2005 review for Reverse Shot, Kristi Mitsuda raised a series of questions. “Did we witness Yi Hyongsu’s empirical version of the movie or Dong-soo’s mental interpretation? Or did we, in fact, see it as Dong-soo would have directed it?” And further: “Did Hong cut away from the embedded piece at an arbitrary point? What does it mean that he chose to shoot both the ‘fictional’ and ‘real’ segments in near-identical styles, replete with conspicuous zooms and without any marked differences to distinguish his own film from that of Yi Hyongsu’s?”


For Slant’s Ed Gonzalez, also writing in 2005, Tale of Cinema “isn’t just some ordinary tale about art imitating life and vice versa; given the structure of the film and overlapping details, it’s easy and tempting to read it as such, except the film-within-a-film doesn’t provoke Dong-soo to imitate its story as much as it opens the floodgates of memory. Hong recognizes the power of cinema to connect us to our personal experiences, but in the way Dong-soo sadly projects his feelings for a long-ago flame onto Young-shil, he also acknowledges its deluding strength.”
 	 		 			
 				
 					 				

 			
 			 		 	 		
In the New Yorker, Richard Brody places Tale of Cinema within the context of Hong’s busy career, and writes that his “ramped-up manipulations of time and continuity, fusions of reality and fantasy, and speculative dramatization of alternate worlds show a cinematized mind at work in real time. When a great filmmaker titles a movie Tale of Cinema, it’s a red flag to herald matters of great personal implication. With its immediate drama and its far-reaching vision of untapped possibilities, this movie fulfills that promise.”

最近打算写一个暴论：金朝汉化不成功，很大程度上也是一个“建国神话”范式。

很多强盛的少数民族王朝都会有这种问题：开国一代人确实武功赫赫，打下了，好大一片积液，但是子孙后代往往被这样伟大的建国神话所迷惑，将一切原因归功于本民族的独特风俗习惯，而忽略了开国一代的艰辛睿智。

金朝上下就普遍存在着这样一种认识：太祖太宗两朝吞辽灭宋武力强盛，那是因为当时的女真人风俗质朴，所以只要勒令女真人保持建国时期的风俗，就能保持军队的战斗力。

这种刻舟求剑的建国神话痴迷和太平洋岛国土著的船货崇拜没区别，如果这些人真的细究一下本国的建国历史，就会意识到：耶律阿保机的契丹和孙万荣的契丹是完全不一致的，完颜阿骨打时代的女真和完颜函普时代也大相径庭，李元昊时代的党项和拓跋思恭相比也有本质的进步——他们开创的辉煌基业，正是在变化的基础上实现的，后世却刻舟求剑的将原因都归结于具体的一个个风俗上。

金人为了维持女真旧俗费了很大的功夫，猛安谋克户实行父子相聚而耕的原始村社，还屡次商议重新均贫富平分地产。直接结果就是落后的生产关系导致军户经营极差，根本竞争不过周围的汉族农民，国家屡次拘刷良田供给他们，大大激化了金朝的民族矛盾。

再就是对建国神话的痴迷导致了对女真人武力的过度想象，即使在金末时期，也妄想建立“北族超人军队”，继续实行汉族耕田供给女真人打仗的愚蠢制度。

联想到前些年某些地方不思政务，完全忘却了为人民服务的宗旨，整天举办重走某某路、唱某某歌的活动，以为这就能天下倾心，万姓拥护，这就能不忘初心，继续奋斗了，所作所为 …</span>

                    <span>This special Guru of the Week series focuses on contracts. Now that we have considered assertions, postconditions, and preconditions in GotWs #97-101, let’s pause and reflect: To what extent does a failed contract imply “UB”… either the Hidden Dragon of Undefined Behavior, or the Crouching Tiger of Unspecified Behavior? JG Question 1. Briefly, what is … Continue reading GotW #102: Assertions and “UB” (Difficulty: 7/10) →</span>

                    <span>Elia Suleiman in It Must Be Heaven (2019)    		
Through Sunday, the Arab American National Museum is presenting the four features Palestinian filmmaker Elia Suleiman has made over the course of more than twenty years. These online screenings are free in the U.S., Canada, and Palestine, but capacity is limited. “On the one hand,” wrote Bilge Ebiri, introducing his interview with the director published on the Current two years ago, Suleiman’s films “are droll, deadpan comedies that at times recall the films of Charlie Chaplin and Jacques Tati, with Suleiman himself often at the center as a quiet, bemused, occasionally melancholy protagonist and observer. But the absurdities in these pictures come from somewhere deadly serious: the surreal texture of life in Palestine under Israeli occupation.”
Suleiman grew up poor in Nazareth, often referred to as “the Arab capital of Israel,” and left the city for New York in his early twenties. In 1994, he moved to Jerusalem and began teaching at Birzeit University in the West Bank and working on Chronicle of a Disappearance (1996), which won an award for best first feature in Venice. In Chronicle, Suleiman “presents a series of tableaux, seemingly unconnected images and incidents that give the impression that they are searching for a unifying narrative thread,” wrote Marjorie Baumgarten in the Austin Chronicle the following year. “Despite their idiopathic expressiveness, no conventional storyline emerges. But together they create a compelling portrait of marginalization and inaction.”


Writing for Artforum, Gary Indiana suggested that Chronicle “would probably look like a post-Godardian exercise in minimalist cinema if its pieces weren’t charged by their setting. Suleiman ponders his identity as a Palestinian; Palestine searches for itself inside a political-military-socioeconomic organism called Israel. Life goes on, but in conditions of nervous uncertainty about the future. The quality of nothing-happening is a freighted sense of something in abeyance, a feeling of fragility about all arrangements and expectations.”


Divine Intervention (2002) premiered in Cannes, won a jury award, and was named the best film in competition by the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI). Set in Nazareth, Divine has a “sketch comedy structure” that is “less an evocation of Israeli aggression than it is a startling acknowledgement of a society’s chilling acclimation to day-to-day terror,” wrote Slant’s Ed Gonzalez. “Perhaps more incredible than the film’s daring structure is the smoothness of the execution—like sharp, many-ridged blade.” The Time That Remains (2008) is “a funny, achingly sad, and discreetly bitter bricolage of embellished autobiography that evolves into a counter-history of the State of Israel, from 1948 onward,” wrote Ella Taylor at the top of her interview with Suleiman for the Village Voice in 2011. “In its oblique, intensely personal way, The Time That Remains inserts an acidic voice into the fierce debates currently being waged in the country about who qualifies as Israeli.”


In 2019, Suleiman returned to Cannes for a third time, winning a special mention from the jury and another FIPRESCI prize for It Must Be Heaven. Here, Suleiman “turns his delightfully absurdist, unfailingly generous gaze beyond the physical homeland, where parallels and dissonance abound,” wrote Jay Weissberg for Variety. He leaves Nazareth for Paris, and then New York, only to find that no matter how far he roams, the world remains just off-kilter enough to keep reminding him of home. Weissberg observes that “Suleiman’s robe of bemusement protects a more fragile body both at home and abroad, where the possibility of exile adds a further level of destabilization: What does it mean to carry one’s roots to a different soil?”

It might seem reasonable to assume that people’s facial expressions are universal — so, for example, whether a person is from Brazil, India or Canada, their smile upon seeing close friends or their expression of awe at a fireworks display would look essentially the same. But is that really true? Is the association between these facial expressions and their relevant context across geographies indeed universal? What can similarities — or differences — between the situations where someone grins or frowns tell us about how people may be connected across different cultures?  
Scientists seeking to answer these questions and to uncover the extent to which people are connected across cultures and geog…</span>

                    <span>Metastability and Distributed Systems
What if computer science had different parents?
There&#x27;s no more time-honored way to get things working again, from toasters to global-scale distributed systems, than turning them off and on again. The reasons that works so well are varied, but one reason is especially important for the developers and operators of distributed systems: metastability.
I&#x27;ll let the authors of Metastable Failures in Distributed Systems define what that means:
Metastable failures occur in open systems with an uncontrolled source of load where a trigger causes the system to enter a bad state that persists even when the trigger is removed.


What they&#x27;re identifying here is a kind of stable down state, where the system is stable but not doing useful work, even though it&#x27;s only…</span>

    Peter Finch and Murray Head in John Schlesinger’s Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971)    		
Most festivals are still hybrid affairs, but the balance is shifting toward getting people back in theaters. Mona Fastvold’s The World to Come, with Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby, will open the second phase of Rotterdam’s fiftieth edition on June 2, presented first online and then in theaters around the city. In all, 139 films, including revivals of Jane Campion’s Sweetie (1989) and Jim Jarmusch’s Night on Earth (1991), will screen through June 9.
Uprising is a new three-part documentary series from Steve McQueen and James Rogan focusing on pivotal moments in 1981 that redefined race relations in Britain, and Sheffield DocFest (June 4 through 13) will host the world premiere of the first hour-long episode. On June 11, BAM Rose Cinemas in Brooklyn will reopen, but BAMcinemaFest (June 23 through 29) will be a strictly virtual event. And Fiktionsbescheinigung. 16 Cinematic Perspectives on Germany, a program focusing on filmmakers of color copresented by the Berlinale Forum and Sinema Transtopia, will stream from June 9 through 30 before heading to outdoor screens in August.


Speaking of the Berlinale, the outdoor summer program, running from June 9 through 20, is now set. On June 18, Tribeca will present the world premiere of Steven Soderbergh’s No Sudden Move, a heist movie set in Detroit in 1954 and starring Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, David Harbour, Ray Liotta, Jon Hamm, Amy Seimetz, Brendan Fraser, Kieran Culkin, and Bill Duke.


Before we turn to the highlights of the week, let’s pause a moment to remember Paul Mooney, the comedian, writer, and actor who passed away on Wednesday at the age of seventy-nine. In the late 1960s, Mooney met and immediately bonded with Richard Pryor, and the two cowrote material for Pryor’s stand-up shows and television appearances as well as Pryor’s autobiographical film Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling (1986). Mooney wrote for and appeared on Chappelle’s Show, and in Spike Lee’s fiercely satirical Bamboozled (2000), he played Junebug, described by Ashley Clark as “a comedian who, pointedly, has retained his dignity by performing culturally specific Black material for Black audiences in small clubs.”



The new issue of Cineaste is out, accompanied by a handful of online exclusives. In print, Michael Sandlin reviews Glenn Frankel’s new book on the making of Midnight Cowboy (1969), and online, Michał Oleszczyk and Alex Ramon discuss John Schlesinger’s follow-up to that film, Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971). If the former—“essentially a gay-tinted buddy movie exploiting the gorgeous squalor of late-1960s Times Square,” as Oleszczyk puts it—hadn’t won three Oscars, the latter might never have been made. “Sunday Bloody Sunday was the film that not only helped shape my notion of what a gay life may have in store for me—more profoundly, it also formed my idea of adulthood itself, as a state of constant flux, imperfect decisions, and pursuit of elusive satisfaction,” says Oleszczyk. Also online: Robert Koehler on Adam Curtis and Michael Sicinski on Kevin Jerome Everson.




This evening at Meanwood Valley Urban Farm, on the outer edge of the English city of Leeds, Pavilion will present outdoor screenings of two films by Nathanial Dorsky and another by his partner, Jerome Hiler, all three of them silent and shot on 16 mm. Will Rose talks with the filmmakers about the relationships between their work and poetry, music, memory, and the changing of the seasons. “Every screening is a law unto itself,” says Hiler. “No two are alike—even when there’s an immediate repeat screening. When I send my films out to be rented, they’re like children old enough to be on their own. I wish them luck. That’s about all I can do.”




Another Screen is currently presenting two outstanding, freely accessible online programs, For a Free Palestine: Films by Palestinian Women and Marguerite Duras on Television. The first half of the Duras program is made up of six interviews the writer and filmmaker conducted in the mid-1960s for Dim Dam Dom, a television magazine broadcast in France once a month on Sundays. Agnès Varda and Claude Lanzmann were regular contributors, and presenters included Françoise Hardy, Geraldine Chaplin, and Romy Schneider. As an interviewer, Duras was a “master of raconteurial abstraction, sometimes even recalling a French John Wilson,” writes Mackenzie Lukenbill at Screen Slate. “While her questions are often cryptic and open-ended (‘What are your thoughts on monkeys?’), they are almost always imbued with the revolutionary zeal of her early journalistic writing in Le 14 juillet and the France Observateur.”




French philosopher Gaston Bachelard “really blew my mind,” Agnès Varda once said in an interview not long after making her first film in California, Uncle Yanco, a portrait of the artist Jean “Yanco” Varda, who was in fact her second cousin. In the new issue of Camera Obscura devoted entirely to Varda, Homay King asks, “What kind of creative imagination has its source not in the divine, in the human mind, in abstract structures like language, in the unconscious, or, finally, as one might expect, in a phenomenological or vitalist account, but solely in the physical and vital properties of matter? I hope to begin to answer this question in a provisional way in this article, through analysis of Varda’s film, an account of Jean Varda’s life and artistic oeuvre, and commentary on Bachelard’s writings on the image.”




Brandon Cronenberg, son of David, is setting up a limited series adaptation of J. G. Ballard’s 2000 novel Super-Cannes, and as it happens, Monday marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the premiere of his father’s controversial Ballard adaptation, Crash—in Cannes, where it won hearty boos and a special prize from the jury. Writing for the Ringer, Adam Nayman finds it “worth asking exactly why Crash raised so many hackles to such a skyscraping degree in 1996 . . . In the neo-Puritan context of MonicaGate, the only thing scarier to cultural gatekeepers than a movie that was too sexy was a movie filled with sex that wasn’t conventionally or marketably sexy at all.” At one point, a character “trawls through a floodlit accident scene snapping photographs,” and the sequence becomes “allegory, autocritique, and accusation all rolled into one: Like all genuinely provocative artists, Cronenberg knows how to turn his audience into rubberneckers.”

Large pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) models, such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-3, T5 and REALM, leverage natural language corpora that are derived from the Web and fine-tuned on task specific data, and have made significant advances in various NLP tasks. However, natural language text alone represents a limited coverage of knowledge, and facts may be contained in wordy sentences in many different ways. Furthermore, existence of non-factual information and toxic content in text can eventually cause biases in the resulting models. 
Alternate sources of information are knowledge graphs (KGs), which consist of structured data. KGs are factual in nature because the information is usua…</span>
