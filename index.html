20世纪是人类使用蒸汽、钢铁和火药争雄海洋的盛大舞台。在波涛汹涌的蓝色世界中，曾经有无数的水手凭借傲人的胆识和技术驾驭宏伟战舰，在弹雨和火焰的交织中献出生命，迷失大海或是成为佩戴光辉勋章的战争英雄，并在短暂的一生去见证人类以勇气、莽撞、智慧以及野心作为旗帜，统御波涛的传奇时代。
本系列文章将以舰船参数，舰船简介和舰船建造与服役记录三个角度，按照舰船建成时间的顺序，对20世纪主要海军国家进行设计和建造的火炮主力战舰（包括战列舰，战列巡洋舰，重巡洋舰和轻巡洋舰）进行简要历史记录，资料均来源于公开渠道期刊杂志与数据库。本文内容不包含任何对战舰的详细评价和讨论，仅作为了解海军战舰发展历程的简单资料整理和展示。希望能够为对海军和相关海战游戏感兴趣的玩家提供游玩和知识的参考~

                <p>I have been enjoying a few of James Propp's essays recently.
 Last month he wrote about the creation of zero.  In

 he writes:


 But in mathematics, premature attempts to reach philosophical
 clarity can get in the way of progress both at the individual
 level and at the cultural level.  Sometimes you have to just
 start talking before you understand what you're talking about.

The past decade has seen remarkable progress on automatic image captioning, a task in which a computer algorithm creates written descriptions for images.

        Hello everyone
So I got an idea to build an easy-to-access journal for everyone, thus reviving an old journaling habit, and Thoughts were born out of this inspiration.

Thoughts provide the end-user with a beautiful user interface to keep them engaged with writing new journal entries describing each day and experience.

If you want to jump into the sea of chaos try the "free open multiplayer room": https://comebrowsewithme.com:8002/login?token=token2&amp;ph

There be dragons. Or just make a private room at the main link and invite whoever you want. Or browse solo. That's cool too.

        Hey Product Hunt Community! 👋 I'm Dante.

Today I'm excited to launch a beta of startupdeck.io. 🥳

• I built this directory to simplify the tool-finding process for both new and experienced startup founders and entrepreneurs.

        Hi @adityavsc &amp; PH!

Ever found yourself "ping-ponging" between document and spreadsheet to copy-paste data into text? ReactiveDocs is a continuation of Reactivepad and its idea of combining sheets and documents. Now it is available as a plugin for Google Docs, so you don't need to use another tool for writing. A plugin for MS Word will follow soon!

Try it out! We'd love to hear what you think.

I know, I know. There's no shortage of trendspotting services. So why another one?

Here's what makes Under the Radar different.

1.) Most trendspotting services include tons of trend signals that either aren't actually growing fast or that everyone already knows about. Hence I've worked hard to develop manual and automated filters that cut out all the fluff. 

In addition, a list of trending keywords, maybe with some "uppy and to t…</p>

        Hello Product Hunt! 👋

How many water bottles do you need? How many USB sticks, or tote bags? The answer is probably less than the number you received after several years working in tech and visiting conferences.

Today the swag industry is a lose-lose — brands waste their money on the same poorly made swag which customers don’t find valuable and end up in trash quickly.

I founded Swag Fair to ensure the promo industry has a better impact on people, the environment, and the economy.

        Good beautiful morning fellow product hunters,

I discovered this product recently while browsing my Twitter feed and loved it because 

1) it solves a big problem 
2) it's open-source and 
3) works with Privacy respective technologies 

This Raspberry 4 based device bridges the gap between generations by allowing them to use the technology they feel comfortable communicating with each other.

The Yayagram has just two but powerful features:

There is a ton micro-repetitive-tasks we need to do every day to get our job done. Creating a task on Jira, adding an event to Google Calendar, sending a message on Slack... just to name a few.

Using multiple tools simultaneously sometimes leads to a bit overwhelming. Switching from your main working app to another app or service on browsers comes with the cost of losing focus and reducing productivity.

Would that be cool if these works can be done without any friction and as…</p>

        We've been hard at work on CryptoCosmos for the last few months, since we first had the idea of minting all the confirmed exoplanets (and Solar System planets!) in the universe as collectable NFTs, using NASA open data sources. Excited to launch this to the world today! Check out our roadmap too for our plans over the coming months.

        I made this to solve my long pain of copy-highlight-download-paste code snippet with highlighting when preparing slides. Till now, it becomes much more than that, markdown-based, embedded components, instant hot reload, built-in recording, etc.

But that said, I'd recommend to try it yourself and you will find why that amazed me a lot.

                <p>Architecture is shaped by its environment and natural forces. Inherently, the discipline focuses on the design of objects over systems, on formal morphology over networks or ecologies. However, no building exists outside its context; every structure is sited among ever-changing climates and cultural conditions. How designers respond and connect to these larger systems can radically change the nature and quality of their work. Often, it is the greatest constraints that produce novel solutions.</p>

              <summary>一步一息，纤毫毕现：浅论《荒野大镖客2》对沉浸感的塑造</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>《荒野大镖客：救赎2》（以下简称《大镖客2》）塑造的世界，无疑是近几年被媒体和玩家公认的最好的开放世界之一。那这款R星八年磨一剑，用无数的人财物力打造的游戏究竟是凭借怎样的手段，让无数玩家沉浸在这个19 世纪最后岁月蛮荒的西部世界中，并享受于这个慢节奏的西部生活呢？而它又是用了哪些方式来加深玩家的沉浸感呢？在这里就简单从玩家的角度谈谈自己的看法。


重电影叙事而不落入其束缚的剧情表现
《大镖客2》的剧情架构，大致符合电影和戏剧中经典的“三幕式结构”。即“第一幕定义冲突；第二幕推动冲突，将其带往不归点；第三幕结束冲突，结局有好有坏。”
其章节性的叙事，让游戏就像一场戏剧。作为一款开放世界游戏的同时，《荒野大镖客》更偏向一款剧情导向作品：玩家只是一个演员，按照预设的剧本去扮演，而无法对结局产生什么根本性影响。玩家所做的，只是在阅读剧情，而非创造剧情。


在这样的设定下，《大镖客2》选择使用了电影化叙事手法。人物对话和过场CG中的镜头语言与电影已经别无二致，甚至在赶路前往任务的过程中还贴心地提供了电影模式镜头。
如果说类电影镜头的过场只是让游戏观感具有电影质感，那么电影模式则让游戏离电影叙事更进一步：极简的UI…</p>

前言：好久不见，系列重新开始更新，不过首先说明两件事情。
其一，因本系列仅把最重要哲学家的最核心观点呈现给读者，因此省略了相当多内容。对此我能想到最好解决方案是在本文的基础上给出必要的补充阅读，当然免费的电子书在网上并不是很好找，我会尽量提供直接的中文或者英文版文章与书籍链接，例如国家图书馆和古腾堡计划(Project Gutenberg)。如果感兴趣的朋友可以拉到文末，按给出的章节去找原文阅读。
其二，在我翻看系列之前文章时，发现过去的写作中出现了一部分错误，感谢指出问题的读者。我会在跟进新文章同时对过去的文章进行修改，例如对洛克与休谟论述的补充与修订。那么我们正式开始。
1. 阅读注意事项
可以说从对笛卡尔的介绍到落脚于休谟问题，全部概念的铺垫都是为了读者能理解本文与接下来一篇文章。因此，我认为有必要说明之后在写作方式上与以往的文章有什么不同。先前的文章我做的仅是单独哲学家的介绍。所以当我使用任何哲学概念时，都停留在单独作者的系统内。在本文，我会同时使用例如“笛卡尔真理观”或“休谟对因果的批判”来代指已经说明…</p>

初次写文章，思路难免混乱，望多多包涵。仅代表个人观点，权当抛砖引玉，欢迎讨论
立回的乐趣
立回，是格斗游戏中的术语，指对战双方在攻击对方成功或防御对方进攻之前所做的一切动作。其目的是使自己进入有利的情况，或者使对手陷入不利的情况。
立回本身是最早用于格斗游戏的术语，但却对于《怪物猎人》的游戏模式异常适用，基本原因在于，《怪物猎人》是个偏被动的游戏。
遇到一个新怪时，先观察怪物的动作前摇，攻击范围，后摇；之后可能会觉得某一个点可以输出，便蹭两刀，觉得有大破绽了，便上去一个蓄力或是登龙；如此反复试错，直到对怪物的所有动作了如指掌，一个抬手便知道是要出什么动作，甚至知道再砍几刀可能出个硬直。把一个怪完全吃透，便算是出师可以去找下一个了。

(毕竟我咩咩子老婆不会骗我)
如此的游戏模式提供的主要是两点乐趣，…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>译者按：
憋了很长时间，译者终于动手了。《透镜人》系列科幻小说，在华人地区可能没什么人知道。但在国际科幻小说圈绝非如此。这是一套在太空歌剧类型科幻小说发展历程上有重要意义的作品。“太空歌剧之父” 爱德华·埃尔默·史密斯从1937年起，历时23年，创作了6部正传和1部外传。1966年和托尔金《魔戒》系列、海因莱因《未来史》系列、巴洛斯《火星公主》一起入围1966年雨果奖 Best All-Time Series 奖项——虽然最后大家一起成为了《基地》系列的陪跑。
问世半个世纪以来，虽然整套系列小说一直在被各路群雄“借梗”：DC的《绿灯侠》、日本动画《宇宙战舰大和号》、《机动战士高达0079》。但由于美国版权方和日本讲谈社之间的一场乌龙纠纷，不仅使得日本讲谈社斥资近千万美元制作的剧场版动画和TV动画无法在21世纪继续发行。也令美国版权方变得异常保守。从而影响了原作的推广。
今天刊出的是1937年发表的第一部《银河巡逻队》的第一章，由于笔者是利用业余时间进行翻译，加上各种客观原因限制，不能保证稳定快速更新，请勿催更。原著在中国大陆和中国港台均已进入公共版权领域。译文很大程度上参考了小西宏和小隅黎（真名柴野拓美）的日…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>纵观当代文学界，以女性从军作为题材的作品似乎并不多。在现当代，几乎各国军队里都有为数不少的女兵，曾经属于女性禁区的海军、空军也有女舰长、女飞行员一类的角色存在。但是在文学作品中，女兵很少成为故事的真正主角，而且也很少能够得到第一视角的公正阐述。也许因为战争本来就很残酷，残酷到能够让最美好的花朵凋谢。
但是在这本《永恒之民无所畏惧》中，年轻的以色列女作家莎妮·薄安久（Shani Boianjiu）却直面了这个严肃的话题，将一个庞大的群体——以色列女兵的生活展现在了许多人面前。
本文将尝试在尽量不剧透的前提下，和读者们一起欣赏这本小说，并顺带谈谈以色列女兵的历史与现状。当然她们并非人均一张盖尔·加朵的脸，但将其称为“合格的战士”是不为过的。

IGN 给游戏打出了8分的成绩，表示其带来了引人入胜且注重战斗的游戏体验。评测者指出，在本作的场景中漫游时，就仿佛是在一个惊悚且致命版的迪士尼乐园里一般。伴随着惊悚狂暴的展开，本作的背后黑暗秘密也被揭晓。尽管头目战有些令人失望，但敌人的多样性让游戏体验相当紧张刺激，尤其是在“硬核难度”下。


与《生化危机7》的慢节奏构造恐惧不同，《生化危机 Village》更接近《生化危机4》的节奏，这可能让有些喜爱前作心理恐怖氛围的玩家有些失望。话虽如此，如果玩家喜爱偏向动作的生存恐怖游戏，那么本作会像蒂米斯特雷库夫人的爪子一样吸引人。


GameSpot 则给游戏打出了9分的好成绩，表示其是集系列恐怖精髓于一身的佳作，同时还加入了独创的全新想法和机制。与之类似的，《生化危机 Village》也融合了系…</p>

                <p>大家好，我是老刘！
为什么把这个math for game develop系列进行搬运翻译？我们大多数人喜欢Unity里面，可视化拖拽的shader编辑器，对于写代码的态度，那是能不写就不写。
但是其实它就是可视化的数学。
当我们提到“数学”，总有先入为主的偏见，大多数人，看见这俩字就头疼。当我们在学校学习“数学”的时候，大多数是因为应付考试，但是时至今日，“数学”对于游戏开发，乃至大数媒领域的工作都至关重要。
我搬运这个系列课程的初衷，就是现在的大学课程，不能覆盖游戏开发行业所需，或者是大数媒领域，你几乎找不到数学在该领域的实际应用性课程。我真诚的希望，通过我们MCATIN译制的这个系列教程，能帮你在这个行业走得更顺，也能走得更远！
汉化不易，希望给我B站账号一键三连，点关注错不了。</p>

They've come a long way since I was a customer, and this should be on every marketer and PM's radar with their no-code a/b testing solutions coupled with their cross-channel customer journey capabilities!

        Hey all,

MINDRIGHT is a simple app based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), designed to help you identify and overcome negative thoughts and limiting beliefs.&nbsp;

I made this app because I believe there are a ton of people who suffer from cognitive distortions, but are uncomfortable getting help. Many are unable to afford a therapist, some even feel shame. Others simply find the whimsical nature of many self help books and apps to be "uncool" and therefore won't engage with them.

        Hi, I made Flext. It's my first app for iOS and I decided to make things difficult for myself by setting a price, $20, that would deter most customers.

I also open sourced the app and licensed it under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0, so in the extremely unlikely event that it becomes successful, the code is right there for copycats to use.

I like to think it's this level of consideration that sets me apart from my peers.

I'm an Australian living and working in the UK and I struggle to stay in touch with friends back home and others who are also living abroad. 

MateMessage started out as a product just for me—it was going to be a spreadsheet and a Zap to send me a random friends' name every week and a reminder to send them a message. Then I thought others might have the same problem, so I've put together the site and got some friends signed up.

I'm keen to find out whether remembering …</p>

        Hey Everyone!
I'm Michal, and this is my newsletter! I've been running it for almost a year now.
Unfortunately I didn't have time to properly promote it. 

This freemium newsletter, showcases viral marketing case studies, where I showed the strategies, tools and psychology behind every virality.

As well as behavioral economics, presented as a sketch, described in a concise way and provided possible applications.

Other than that I showcase other creative marketing campaigns and social media…</p>

        Hey Everyone -

I wanted to see if I can come up with an (albeit rough) index of how much Dogecoin is trending on Twitter to see if there is any signal in terms of price action. Let me know how you like it and any feedback you have. :)

May the Doge be with you,

        I saw "Camo" for using a phone as a WebCam, but that only works with iPhones, which I don't use. I was searching for an Android solution and found this one and it works really well. You can attach it via USB for a wired connection as well.  Totally acceptable at the FREE level …

… then the $4.49 upgrade to "Pro" gets you exposure controls, color controls, white balance, flash on/off, image mirror, zoom bar, and more. 

Nice app. Made in Finland. 🇫🇮

我所在的城市位于广东西部，因为这里有一座华南地区最大的炼油厂，所以这座城市又被称为“油城”

在这里的年轻人，在他们高中毕业后或者寻找工作的时候，大部分都会离开这里，离开的年轻人很少回来，或者不回了。

(一张合影，宣告着自己在这里或者与他人相处的时间不多了)
我有时候也想着毕业后就离开，但在这个小城市待久了，习惯了这里的一切，又害怕离开，自己便陷入了这种矛盾状态。

周伟光无意间，从旧书堆里发现了一份页面已经发黄了的装订成册的手稿，这份手稿看起来像是用不同的纸张堆叠起来的，拿在手里有一种非常厚实的感觉。那些纸张让周伟光联想到过去使用的草纸，木浆刷出来的厚实的纸张。他不记得自己什么时候弄到过这么一本书。
那些纸页上写满了密密麻麻的小字，大多数是繁体字，有些字周伟光虽然认识，但是那些字显然是用一种更古老的未知字形写出来，凭借着前后句子的联系还有古字的大概样子，周伟光可以猜得出来那是什么意思。
“禺疆入主乾坤地，寰宇迷藏无处寻。后土低吟哀歌响，万古宏声殒天星……”周伟光不记得自己什么时候有研究过这些东西，他立刻坐到书桌前，把这堆无意间翻出来的资料摊开来，开始仔细的研究……
不知不觉天就亮了，周伟光一夜未眠。有意思的是，他好像一点都没有觉得疲劳，反而有一种持续的非常兴奋的感觉。他把自己的激动情绪解释为学术上有了新发现的那种激动，但是不知道为什么，心底还有一种莫名的不安隐藏在这种躁动之下。
其实，带着这种类似情绪的，不仅仅只有周伟光一个人。赵华和林晓悦两个人不知不觉在图书馆泡到了天亮，结果他们就真的这样认真的研究了一宿。周伟光给他们临时布置的这个“课外作业”让他们倍感意外，…</p>

近日，日本长寿动画剧集《名侦探柯南》在迎来动画25周年，官方也趁此机会搞了不少的“大动作”。 
首先，延期一年的剧场版《绯色的子弹》（緋色の弾丸）首次实现了包括中国大陆在内的多个国家和地区同步上映。


当然，除此以外，近期还有一个引起热烈讨论的事件，那就是《柯南》的TV版也迎来了第1000集。该集作为特别企划，重制了《柯南》原第11集的《钢琴奏鸣曲〈月光〉杀人事件》（下称《月光》）。


该篇章讲述毛利一行人被一位叫麻生圭二的委托人邀请到“月影岛”办案，不料去到当地才得知，该委托人其实早已去世。而围绕这位委托人，后续也发生了一系列的命案。
而柯南这个角色在该篇章中，也出现了一个标志性观念转变:此后，他决不允许任何一个犯人在他眼前自杀。
这个故事在日本国内外都有着极高的人气，也被看作是柯南系列的一个原点。



(新旧版本对比：案件最后，犯人把柯南抛出火场)
而伴随着上述的这些大动作，在《柯南》的粉丝群体之中，也出现了不少的争议和讨论。
一方面，以新《月光》的讨论为例，中日社交网络上的粉丝们当中，有很多人认为，新制作的重制版制作水平下降严重，并不能…</p>

在《BALDO》的开放世界中，玩家将和各类形形色色的角色进行互动，在精心打造的小镇中发现各类有趣的事物。除了独特的人物及风景之外，玩家也将解开谜题、探索地牢，有时还将与风格各异的各类敌人进行战斗。 


在2020年春季举行的独立世界直播活动中，开发团队宣布本作将在 Nintendo Switch 限时独占，并定于同年夏季发售，但最终由于疫情等因素推迟。目前，《BALDO》目前暂无发售日期，但开发者表示有望在年内发售。</p>

                <p>这次应该算是自己第一次尝试拼装FAG系列的产品，不得不说对于我这种被万代“惯坏了”的玩家而言，制作的体验实在是有些过于糟糕了。一方面是寿屋模型本身的感受：水口较大、零件硬度太高水口难削、分件不合理（多处可遮盖的水口都露在外面、不需要无缝的结构拆成两段增加工作量等）——另一方面则是碍于机娘的题材：躯干肉色部分的曲面无缝部位太多、肉色部分及头发部分的渐变效果处理等等。总体的制作感受真的比万代的机器人题材产品难多了，下次如果有想要的寿屋机娘玩具绝对去找代工了！
牢骚发完了，大家看图吧！
先来张配件一览


轻装的效果








满分的屁股


身上通用孔位很多，武器的装备位置可以自由选择还是蛮好的。








两只刀鞘也可以装备在同一边。




三叉戟取自robot魂的柯达尔行刑小队配件包。






全装备造型










和最近刚入手的千值练兰斯洛特联动下。


结局当然是大破啦。


最后一张收尾。


好了，分享内容大概就是这些，我以后打死也不要再做寿屋的机娘了！</p>

早上凌晨六点，广治穿着白色背心从二环边上的小破屋出来，他黑色的脚杆上穿着两只掉色的拖鞋，他揉了揉惺忪的眼睛，打了个哈欠，声音顺着喉管流出，广治醒了，在他打了哈欠之后，之前的他昏昏欲睡，是一具行尸走肉。
广治抬头看见了一抹阳光洒在自家破败的花园里，那光好强烈，周围的一切仿佛遁入黑夜。广治隐约地觉得阳光底下有个人，他现在视线模糊，还没对焦在一起。他看见一个浑身洁白，像是一块白玉的裸背，上面还披着发亮的银发，广治觉得那是一个女人，他觉得那么美丽的背不可能存在于男人的脊背上。那束发亮的头发左右摇摆，像是一个活物。
广治抬脚准备上去搭话，脚步逐渐轻快起来，他有一种想抱住那个女人的冲动，广治走到一半时停住了，他发觉自己的脚太黑，似乎不太适合进入那抹神圣的阳光，他不想玷污那束圣洁的白发，好似不想触摸一幅神圣的画。
广治停下了脚步，现在他站在了阳光与房屋阴影的交界处，他的脊背被笼罩在黑色的影子里。
广治在太阳底下望着那个女人，那束头发散发着在河边采摘的新鲜百合的清香。广治听见天上发出震耳的雷鸣，广治下意识地看了下天，天上的白云层层堆叠，像是快要下雨了。
那股白色的头发不安焦躁地四处摆动着，发出一声洪亮的…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>因宿舍情况不能用专业的模型器材，所以我在阳台上用买来的油画颜料跟笔玩了两个月的模型，然后分享一下心得。

(首先是阳台，为啥是阳台，因为种种的问题会干掉舍友。)

(几只烂笔就是我的涂色工具)
 接下來看看我的模型桌。



(犹如贫民窟的作业环境)

(稀释液，火机油跟松节油（因为松节油稀释不了所以吃灰）)
现在来看看模型制作过程。





(塑料感强的件)
先用底色再加一些旧化特调。

(有點不均勻)
最后经过一番调配跟拼装（一个月过后）。

(内部（魔鬼藏在细节里）)

(蓝色那块我想加点色可以做到那种被K过的感觉)
 头部比较偷懒，因为不想调底色，直接用旧化特调加黑色刷的 。

(角是用强力胶把两种不同的角合在一起然后贴在头上的)
撞钉部分是用白色加旧化。



(表现一种在泥堆里滚出来的感觉)
 喷气背包就用蓝色涂然后干刷旧化 。





(整体，有些内部我还没修)



(脚的那块黑色无论如何都刷不上去，索性不刷了直接加旧化了)
这两个月拼下来除了身心俱疲——因为两个凳子高度相同，都是弯腰做的——涂色尤其难，因为稀会导致板件用刷子着色，加了稀释剂更加难刷，所以一般有些旧化涂上蹭一下就会掉一半，…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>大家好，我是老刘！
为什么把这个math for game develop系列进行搬运翻译？我们大多数人喜欢Unity里面，可视化拖拽的shader编辑器，对于写代码的态度，那是能不写就不写。
但是其实它就是可视化的数学。
当我们提到“数学”，总有先入为主的偏见，大多数人，看见这俩字就头疼。当我们在学校学习“数学”的时候，大多数是因为应付考试，但是时至今日，“数学”对于游戏开发，乃至大数媒领域的工作都至关重要。
我搬运这个系列课程的初衷，就是现在的大学课程，不能覆盖游戏开发行业所需，或者是大数媒领域，你几乎找不到数学在该领域的实际应用性课程。我真诚的希望，通过我们MCATIN译制的这个系列教程，能帮你在这个行业走得更顺，也能走得更远！
汉化不易，希望给我B站账号一键三连，点关注错不了。</p>

首先是外盒展示，有一说一这次没采用日版的小盒而是跟上一个开箱中的忍尾将棋一样的大薄盒的设计个人觉得有点难受（因为不好带出门去奶茶店坐着打牌了）上一个的传送门： 忍者主题桌游《忍尾将棋》预售版开箱。




开盒之后依旧是那张小卡片。这个桌游的卫星什么时候落地啊，难受。


说明书，简中繁中各一份，好评。


计分板。讲真单看起来还是很好看的，也是简中繁中各一份。对我来说繁中的就是备用品了。


下面的就是剩下的牌和金属token了。这就是为什么我反而不喜欢这次设计的原因，太空了。


先从右边的人物卡和功能卡牌堆开始介绍（这一摞是简繁中各一份，只做部分展示）。首先是我们的人物卡，也就是你的初始五选二，然后当对面到达15分（赛程过半时）可启用仅一次的二选一…</p>

Sensuous, dreamlike, & charged with discomfiting sexuality, the experimental psychodramas of Josephine Decker are bracing explorations of the complex power dynamics at play in intense relationships.

Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models have become a favoured approach for tackling natural language generation tasks, with applications ranging from machine translation to monolingual generation tasks, such as summarization, sentence fusion, text simplification, and machine translation post-editing. However these models appear to be a suboptimal choice for many monolingual tasks, as the desired output text often represe…</p>

文稿、设计：南桥北桥不是桥
Epic Game 与 Apple 关于垄断的庭审已开庭。而这场没有硝烟的战争，从进入大众视线起到现在已经有近一年的时间。
事情起源于 Epic 绕开苹果商店提供内购通道，苹果随即以其违反商店规定为由将《堡垒之夜》下架，并威胁 Epic Game 要关闭其开发者账户。平台与开发商\发行商间的矛盾再一次进入大众视线。同时，Epic 自家运营的游戏平台又在 PC 上卷起了新的浪潮，而这对玩家有着怎样的影响？开发者又将如何做出抉择？
游戏产业稳健增长，PC 成为兵家重地
近年，游戏产业正在稳步增长，据相关数据统计，2020年游戏产业在全球范围内的营收将达到1646亿美元。全球78亿人口中有26.9亿游戏玩家，平均每三个人中就有一位游戏玩家。尽管2018年开始总体增速有小幅度下滑，但随着疫情等因素的影响，全球游戏营收预计在未来两年加速增长。


其中 PC 游戏部分预计占据 2020 全年游戏产业营收的 36.9%。考虑到PC设备的保有量，PC 平台将一直是各大游戏公司的必争之地，极具潜力。

                <p>索尼互动娱乐现已与 Discord 达成战略合作伙伴关系。从明年年初开始，PlayStation 主机及 APP 将与 Discord 进行深度集成，从而让玩家享受更为优质的社交沟通体验。Discord 是一款专为社区设计的免费网络实时通话软件与数字发行平台，用户之间可以在聊天频道通过信息、图片、视频和音频进行互动，其用户总数超过1.4亿。


索尼互娱总裁兼首席执行官 Jim Ryan 表示，双方在愿景及价值观方面可以说是志同道合，而在其本人与 Discord 联合创始人 Jason Citron 和 Stan Vishnevskiy 进行沟通后，索尼互娱最终参投了 Discord H轮融资，从而让双方的关系更为紧密。
此前，微软曾作价百亿美元试图收购 Discord，但最终未能达成协议。有鉴于 Discord 与索尼互娱的本次达成的深度合作，Discord 似乎拒绝投入微软的怀抱，而是选择在保持独立的前提下与索尼共同发展。</p>

我第一次了解到《死亡回归》这款游戏是去年六月份索尼PS5的发布会上，但我得承认我当时对这款游戏没多大兴趣。特别是这款游戏的科幻主题在游戏界抬头一看是比比皆是：太空人驾驶飞船坠落在神秘星球，然后需要在充斥黑暗与风暴的星球上，在外星生物的围堵中杀出一条血路，再加上制作组刻意冠上的夸张名称，呵呵，很牛逼嘛？
但在这里，我很高兴地说我这种刻板印象大错特错！《死亡回归》这款刚刚发售的游戏有很多让人欣喜的东西，说的简单一点：这款游戏给我们带来的是只有游戏能够为我们带来的独特体验，这让我对游戏媒介的未来极为兴奋。
《死亡回归》的女主瑟琳是一名宇航员。她除了有虹膜异色症之外这个特征之外，以游戏世界的标准来说，就实在没啥值得称道的特点了。她既不是七尺身的超级战士，也不是《龙与地下城》里面拥有拯救世界这种标配“爱好”的美女模特。剧情的设定也是稀松平常：游戏开始于瑟琳的宇宙船穿过了叫做Atropos（亚戳波斯）星球上马毛猬磔的云层，循着被称为“白色阴影”的信号声来到了这个神秘的星球。一道闪电“不可避免”地击中了飞船的外壳，然后瑟琳也…</p>

                <p>E3 主办方娱乐软件协会于日前发表声明，就原定出席今年展会的科乐美宣布退出活动一事做出回应。娱乐软件协会表示，支持其不参加今年活动的决定，协会也期待科乐美在明年重返 E3 时凭借准备就绪的游戏会带给广大玩家什么样的惊喜。与此同时，主办方也强调今年的活动会有来自其他公司的诸多重磅消息，也请玩家期待今年的展会。


科乐美此前表示，退出今年的 E3 是由于目前公司的一些关键游戏项目需要更多的时间，他们也会在未来的数月中适时将详情公之于众。尽管最终决定退出 E3，公司也会一如既往的支持娱乐软件协会，并提前预祝今年的展会举办顺利。


今年4月，科乐美注册了《潜龙谍影崛起》及《恶魔城》系列商标，同时《潜龙谍影》官方社交媒体还暗示将推出《潜龙谍影2》重制版，或许这些就正是科乐美所说的“关键游戏项目”。不论科乐美是否真的在开发传闻中的游戏，看起来我们都能在今年获得旗下 IP 的新消息。</p>

与漫画的回忆
大今良时老师开始看漫画是受到哥哥的影响，因为哥哥经常看，所以家里经常散落着青年志、少年志啥的，老师就捡剩读一读。其中老师最喜欢的是《YOUNG JUMP》、《Young Magazine》的画风和氛围。另一方面老师觉得少年漫画杂志画面比较紧凑，读起来相对困难一些。
因为家里没有人读少女漫画，所以这方面的内容老师基本没有涉猎。有一次老师看到了一部主要面向小女孩儿的少女漫画，剧情是朋友用自己的手掌去温暖被敌人冰冻的主角，然后敌人一边感叹说：这就是友情的力量么一边离场了。因为完全不习惯这种演出，大今良时老师就吐槽：这怎么可能嘛！
大今良时老师第一部沉迷的作品是小学四年级时在杂志上看到的《3×3EYES》，看到那个画面的瞬间线条也变得闪闪发光了，因为画得太好了让老师十分动容，便收集了全部的单行本。老师说自己当时彻头彻尾地迷上了主人公八云。
漫画这方面老师还沉迷过《幽游白书》，动画的话则是《无限的未知》，游戏方面老师喜欢的是《时空之轮》。



创作者的起点
除了一直坚持画画，大今良时老师还同时学习了日本民舞。原先老师经常在练习结束后和朋友们一起出去玩儿。这份爱好也一直…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>太长不看版：


正文：
小渣是一名喜欢3A游戏的大学生，今天早上刚看完《生化危机：村庄》的最新演示视频，心头一热打开Steam就准备预购，只是豪华版472，标准版396的定价让他有点下不去手。


小渣一边在心里痛骂黑心日厂游戏越卖越贵，一边打开福报家想找便宜的商家代购。曾几何时，福报家国区8折礼物是他入手最新大作的惯用渠道：在福报家下单之后，商家会用机器人小号加自己Steam好友，然后发送国区礼物并入库激活。小渣觉得这种购买方式不仅简单而且安全，虽然偶尔也看到过黑礼物被收回的情况，但他坚信这种小概率事件不会发生在自己身上。
然而由于历史原因，《生化危机》系列游戏已经被福报家屏蔽了搜索，小渣问了几个熟悉的店家，要么只提供低价区代购，要么是国区98折，他都不太能接受。
此时小渣想到了另外一种低价买国区游戏的方法——Steam充值卡。有些店铺会出售低价充值卡，50美元的面额通常只卖240人民币左右，也相当于打了7-8折。但是Valve官方在2020年出台了充值卡锁区政策，禁止跨区充值，想要走这个路子只能改区让店家代充，需要把Steam账号密码交给商家，这让小渣不太放心。


店家还提供Steam市场余额交易等变…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>火星内战
在荷鲁斯之乱爆发后，这场内战对帝国分裂之深逐渐显现：不仅仅是帝皇的九个星际战士军团调转矛头，其中更有原火星铸造总监卡尔博哈尔也站到了战帅一边，只为求得开发帝皇禁止的禁忌科技，并最终引发了可怕的火星内战。而这一切还要从当时的火星局势说起。
当时的火星正值大远征的后期，火星内部逐渐对于帝皇是否是欧姆尼赛亚，以及帝皇的各种政策展开了各种激烈的辩论，并使得火星乃至整个机械教逐渐分为了以卡尔博哈尔为代表的，“帝皇不是圣灵，并且帝皇还禁止了机械教对于禁忌技术的研发”一派；以及他们的反对派。而随着火星的局势逐渐紧张，准备叛乱的战帅便看准时机向火星秘密派出了曾经火星在战帅身旁的代表作为秘密特使，也就是鲁古鲁斯。此人向着当时卡尔博哈尔许诺只要他们站到战帅一边，他们可以在之后自由研究任何禁忌的技术，并且还给他们开启曾经由帝皇亲自封印的莫拉维地堡。
在莫拉维地堡开启之后，包括卡尔博哈尔在内的一系列当时在场的火星机械教高层都被包含亚空间力量的腐化废码所感染，瞬间被腐化，并很快接受了混沌力量，向战帅宣誓了效忠，并誓要将火星献给战帅。

                <p>体验过《上古卷轴5》的玩家一定都对游戏中在酒馆出现的几首民谣印象深刻。这些歌曲不仅曲调悠扬动听，还很好的反映了游戏设定的背景，使玩家能够通过音乐更加沉浸投入到游戏的世界中。《上古卷轴OL》很好地沿袭了这个元素，并且精心谱写了更多贴合游戏背景的民谣，用吟游诗人的歌声带领玩家们领略庞大的游戏世界。今天我们就一起来聊聊这些在原版游戏中出现的吟游诗人歌谣和它们背后蕴含的故事。
阵营类：女王艾琳颂，三心合一，格林纳巴沼泽之战
在泰伯·塞普汀的统治到来以前，整个泰姆瑞尔帝国处于一片混乱之中，以致于诗人特拉西翠斯把那段时期称之为持续动荡的“洋溢着鲜血和邪恶的日日夜夜”。

——《帝国简史，卷一》
在《上古卷轴》的世界线中，第二纪元是一个充满纷争与变革的时代。西罗帝尔帝国失去了它的继承人，进入了王位空位期。围绕着王权长达五百年的争斗使帝国的力量逐渐衰弱，而泰姆瑞尔各个角落上的势力则相继崛起，渴望接过帝国的大旗。在东部的天际，晨风和黑沼泽，诺德人、暗精灵和亚龙人组成了黑檀心公约（Ebonheart Pact）；在西部的高岩和落锤，布莱顿人、红卫和兽人组建了匕落联盟（Daggerfall Covenant）；在南部的夏暮群岛、威…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>大家好，我是老刘！
为什么把这个math for game develop系列进行搬运翻译？我们大多数人喜欢Unity里面，可视化拖拽的shader编辑器，对于写代码的态度，那是能不写就不写。
但是其实它就是可视化的数学。
当我们提到“数学”，总有先入为主的偏见，大多数人，看见这俩字就头疼。当我们在学校学习“数学”的时候，大多数是因为应付考试，但是时至今日，“数学”对于游戏开发，乃至大数媒领域的工作都至关重要。
我搬运这个系列课程的初衷，就是现在的大学课程，不能覆盖游戏开发行业所需，或者是大数媒领域，你几乎找不到数学在该领域的实际应用性课程。我真诚的希望，通过我们MCATIN译制的这个系列教程，能帮你在这个行业走得更顺，也能走得更远！
汉化不易，希望给我B站账号一键三连，点关注错不了。</p>

              <summary>《悬崖之上》：一篇高分作文</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>文章包含剧透内容，请谨慎阅读
在中国第五代导演中，张艺谋可以说是最优秀和最高产的，特别是近几年来，拍片的速度不断加快，让人感觉已经70岁的他颇有些中国版“伊斯特伍德”的意思。 在今年的“五一档”，张艺谋执导的《悬崖之上》公映，看了将近一年的贴片预告后终于能看到正片，这让我十分期待，于是第一时间便买了票观看。
先说总体感受：《悬崖之上》是一部张艺谋风格很浓重的电影，虽然称不上是神作，但可以看作是张艺谋写给同行看的一篇高分作文。


十多年前，谍战剧题材在国产电视剧行业内着实火了一把，其中不乏经典佳作，比如《暗算》、《潜伏》、《黎明之前》以及与本片有着千丝万缕联系的《悬崖》等。然而在国产电影行业，却鲜见这种题材的作品，时至今日能让人印象深刻的，似乎也只有《风声》这一部作品。
我个人分析，这很大程度的原因是谍战题材的作品往往在时间和空间上有一个比较长的延续性，而电影的时长不太能满足这种需求，电视剧则因为集数较多，可以很好的将谍战过程中敌我双方的斗智斗勇展现出来。《风声》之所以能够成功，很大程度上靠的也是故事本身具有“密室杀人”性质的色彩，将空间与时间都缩到了一个点上，从而将整个故事更好的呈现出来。


而《悬崖之上…</p>

        Hello Product Hunters!

It's 2021 and most of us still consume our vitamins and supplements like our parents and grandparents did.

Many of us don't even take our vitamins everyday — because of the inconvenience of clunky plastic bottles, terrible taste, and added sugar of gummies.

We wanted to change all that. 

That's why we're delighted to introduce NuStrips - your new wellness sidekick!

        I had a challenge where I needed to meet some contractual obligations around backing up everything we had up, and discovered that there wasn't a good solution to doing this for Bitbucket.

I didn't want to rely on our git repository backups being on developer machines, and I wanted to be sure that we had a robust solution in place to restore should the worst happen, either from a service failure or a malicious actor.

        Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Mate here, maker of Historico! Long-time Product Hunt follower, first-time launcher.

Originally, I’ve built Historico to spend time on my iPhone usefully. Instead of endlessly scrolling through Instagram or Twitter, I decided to learn a new fact every day which could serve as a conversation starter for my friends.

        Hey Product Hunt 👋

FoldersLint is a directory structure linter for JavaScript projects.

        Hi there, I'm Corey 👋

Today I'm excited to announce the nonprofit community management platform that we've been working on. 😄

Early in my career I was able to join and partner with an organization in Eastern Africa. We were a small organization, but we were able to make a large impact on the community that we were working in. 

Our team was lean - meaning that we needed to leverage software tools in order to operate and manage our community of donors and beneficiaries. At the time, we bu…</p>

                <p>This is a renovation of a 40-year-old wooden house built on the approach to Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto. It is in a great location with a forest-like park on the front and a river on the back. It had an underground storeroom and a loft, and we think the possibility of a space that spreads vertically.

All of this of course armed with the experience of how to run statistical analysis of large anonymous datasets to ge…</p>

        Hey Product Hunt 👋

Metalink is a URL shortener that lets you add custom meta tags to any URL. This is super useful for making your links look great when you share them on Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin.

I built Metalink to solve my own problem - I wanted to share a link on Twitter, but it didn't look very nice. After a couple of hours of hacking last night, this is what I came up with.

Let me know if you find this tool useful! What features should I add next?

P.S. I'm building Metalink i…</p>

                <p>&#8220;
        Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Six months ago, I launched The Top Chat. A Slack add-on allowing you to schedule messages to be sent later.

The app got immediately the attention and quickly hit 100 signups.
By then I realised a need to make it a bit more valuable.

The idea of recurring messages has been sitting with me for quite some time, but finally decided to make it real.

From now on there is an option to set up a recurring message for:
- ✅ contacts in your DMs
- ✅ multi-people chats 
- ✅ publi…</p>

        There are a ton of companies launching into the passion/creator economy space looking for a way to give power back to the artists. We are a firm believer that musicians need a platform that was built specifically for them. What fans want from artists is entirely different from what fans want from a twitch streamer, youtuber, and all other kinds of creators that are successful on websites like Patreon, Bitclout, and OnlyFans.

Artists need something built for them, and that's exactly what we …</p>

I've just released SEO Toolbelt, a side-project I've been working on alongside my full-time job as an Ecommerce SEO consultant.

I've created this free resource for one simple reason.

This is my second project, boolu.

My wife works in the marketing department of a company, they manage more than 20 clients and each one has their 8 social networks, crazy!

Talking with HER I said, "Well.. why not making a dashboard that integrates all these social networks and that allows you to change from one client to another quickly?"

What's more, why not have them create custom dashboards with the widgets they want? you can see and customize only what you won't see…</p>

发电卫星群产生的电力以微波等形式传输到用电端。各个SIDE的发电卫星群产生的电力除了供应本SIDE的生活生产需求外，甚至还能有多余的电力供给地球圈和月球殖民地使用。出售太阳能发电卫星群产生的电力甚至成为各个SIDE相当重要的经济收入来源。


(在宽阔的宇宙空间，能够部署海量卫星形成太阳能发电卫星群。太阳能发电卫星群几乎无间断的处于太阳照射下。其产生的电力除了足够供应本SIDE生活生产外，还有相当部分富余。)(单个发电卫星大小便达到了千米级。其产生的电力以微波等形式传输给用电方。)

建造太阳能发电卫星群的技术难度相当低，论需要的技术其实在宇宙世纪之前就已经接近成熟。但是使用太阳能的限制也非常明显：建立大规模的太阳能发电卫星群的初期建设成本并不算低，且大量的太…</p>

                <p>入坑时间可能有两年左右，期间也拍过一些作品，奈何有时出来的图像成品并不满意，所以在一些照片上做了不少后期，只用手机一个软件增加噪点质感，调整曲线改变整张图的颜色氛围，这个过程真的非常有趣，尤其调整曲线改变图像的色调的时候。不过几乎不直接使用滤镜，自行调整想要的效果。

(只能说这个软件在你不想打开电脑的时候能满足一部分处理图像的需求。)





(这三张就是纯粹用手机一个软件完成的图，代价就是图片在电脑上看的时候质量就变差ORZ，还有很多就不列出来了)
以天空作为背景板
这两天突发奇想，想拍一些以天空作为背景板的图，不再用手机软件制作导出图片。有时候在游戏里天气会影响光线照射，想拍照的时候就乌云密布非常气人，不过蹲到晴天拍下的照非常的美。
角色们定格下来的动态也是让人看的很入迷。

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>其实这次道具，和之前的有些不太一样，是一位《塞尔达》系列的老玩家，为自己孩子的生日，定做的生日礼物。


毕竟大家都幻想过可以手持自己游戏中的武器，短暂的体验那种中二的快乐。而这次的客户，则是为自己的孩子定制一套《塞尔达》的生日礼物。
最终在我设计的几个方案里面，老哥选了现在的这个版本。
我的想法是，给孩子做一辆《旷野之息》的摩托车哈哈哈


经典的大师剑和大师盾，外加一个打开后自带BGM与灯光的宝箱。让孩子在生日那天，可以开启自己冒险中的第一个宝箱，举起属于自己的那件武器。
Its dangerous to go alone! Take this.
独自冒险很危险！请带上它。 


当然，之所以宝箱开启时候BGM是英杰力巴尔的音乐，是感觉傲娇的鸟叔很有年轻父亲和孩子的那种关系。一面不服输，一面又希望可以帮助孩子飞得更高，最终超过自己吧。</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>大家好，我是老刘！
为什么把这个math for game develop系列进行搬运翻译？我们大多数人喜欢Unity里面，可视化拖拽的shader编辑器，对于写代码的态度，那是能不写就不写。
但是其实它就是可视化的数学。
当我们提到“数学”，总有先入为主的偏见，大多数人，看见这俩字就头疼。当我们在学校学习“数学”的时候，大多数是因为应付考试，但是时至今日，“数学”对于游戏开发，乃至大数媒领域的工作都至关重要。
我搬运这个系列课程的初衷，就是现在的大学课程，不能覆盖游戏开发行业所需，或者是大数媒领域，你几乎找不到数学在该领域的实际应用性课程。我真诚的希望，通过我们MCATIN译制的这个系列教程，能帮你在这个行业走得更顺，也能走得更远！
汉化不易，希望给我B站账号一键三连，点关注错不了。</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>《指环王：护戒使者》开场的这一段念白，也正是这几日心境的代表。接触《魔戒》到现在也正好二十年，一方面，终于在电影院看到了院线版的《护戒使者》《双塔奇兵》，心中的激动与感慨无以复加，另一方面，看到自己喜欢的作品被一星差评， 以及随之而来的又一波相互攻击、拉黑和站队，心情犹如林谷会议中的弗罗多·巴金斯在魔戒上看到争吵的众人。而所见的转发文章中，大多依旧侧重于重申这部作品在幻想文学、电影上的地位。我认同其中的许多观点，但也觉得这样的评论在强调这部作品的门槛之外，并无益于帮助路人和潜在的爱好者更好地理解这部作品。同时也发现这几年重走魔戒之路，重新阅读和观看时，对这部作品新的理解和感悟也很难在现有的文章里找到。这些感慨、不满和诉说的渴望，就是写下本文的动机。
（注：The Lord of the Rings 按照译法习惯不同，在指电影时用《指环王》，在指书籍时用《魔戒》，译名采用文景版译名。但写到感情上来了也许会混用，请见谅）
幻想之始
《魔戒》是引领我进入幻想世界的最早几部作品之一，如今接触了繁多的幻想作品，并投身幻想创作，更能感受到这部作品的朴实无华和澎湃浩瀚，这一次重新观看电影，也是一次返璞归真之旅，如同一个见过…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>最早看到《圣莫妮卡》这个游戏是在忘了哪位朋友的朋友圈里，当时他配的那句话大意就是我今天文章的标题。结果看完这哥们的朋友圈之后，我给他回了一个“+1”。 


这些年，桌游发新的速度越来越快，我在以前的文章和节目里都有多次聊到这个话题。因为新作品出现速度太快，“酒香不怕巷子深”这句话早就已经不太好使了，哪怕是再优秀的游戏设计、再大拿的设计大师，也得靠游戏美术和颜值先抓住玩家的眼球，先抓住关注的焦点。先让人记住你，才有后面游戏感受如何、平衡怎么样、机制好不好……如果一开始就没能激起个水花，那后面的事怕就没什么可操心的了。
想必说到这，大家脑海里都能想到几个抓住过自己的高颜值作品，其中的佼佼者们，只靠一个照面就能让人下决心剁手。而在今天，这个队伍里已经又多了这款《圣莫妮卡》。


其实要说出版方 AEG 向来都是非常注意游戏产品表现的，尤其在美术方面更是经常会有令人印象深刻的作品，这次能捣鼓出一个如此清新动人的《圣莫妮卡》来，也在情理之中。

(《GTA5》真是经典之作)
说到《圣莫妮卡》，相信很多人都不陌生，也许你曾经到过实地，也许你在电影和美剧里见过这里，也许你是在旅游图片上曾经看到，又或者你曾经沉迷于《GTA…</p>

                <p>涉及博彩？万代等厂商终止赛事合作
在4月中旬结束的WUFL（WePlay Ultimate Fighting League）上，主办方携手万代南梦宫和NRS（NetherRealm Studios）为大家献上了《铁拳7》、《真人快da 11》等项目的精彩线下赛事。然而在5月1日，万代南梦宫和NRS同时发表了声明，表示与WUFL在标准等方面存在着差异，因此决定与WUFL终止合作。双方的声明措辞几乎一致，不过在声明中并没有透露终止合作的具体原因。


WUFL随后作出回应称，对这两家厂商的声明感到惊讶，表示曾在赛前赛后都试图与对方商讨未来，不过并没有得到对方的回复。


据悉，本届WUFL的赞助商为博彩公司1xBet。该公司曾因涉嫌非法活动而被英国相关部门撤销牌照。此前也曾赞助过切尔西和利物浦足球俱乐部，后来同样因涉嫌非法活动而离场。万代南梦宫和NRS或是防止博彩的渗透而作出声明，并中断合作。在赛事期间，万代南梦宫没有对赛事相关报道进行转发，其在赛事期间或有了终止后续合作的打算。

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>5月2日，《少女前线》迎来来了它的五岁生日。散爆官方也趁着这次机会，在上海中国船舶馆举办了《少女前线》五周年线下嘉年华活动。与此同时，官方公布了《逆向坍塌：面包房行动》的最新宣传和战斗 PV ，揭晓了不少答案。 


&lt;内嵌内容，请到原网页查看&gt;

据悉，《逆向坍塌：面包房行动》是由 MICAteam 云母组制作的一款正统的策略战棋类游戏。游戏设定为《少女前线》剧情之后，世界由于新的世界大战而重新分裂成两边格局，被称为“第二次冷战”。 在《逆向坍塌：面包房行动》中，玩家为了争夺能改变战争格局的尖端技术，新兴的“南极联邦”与老牌列强国家组成的“罗克萨特主义合众国联盟”之间的各种冲突在世界各地展开着。 


开发者确认，主角的妹妹黎格活了下来并会以更加强力的姿态加入战场。同时，开发者还再次强调《逆向坍塌》是充满爱与希望的故事，之前“妹妹酱”的插曲其实是暗插了黎格特殊体质的线索。


正因如此，诺耶露与黎格之间的关系也成为了此次嘉年华中最引人注目的焦点，官方表示此次重制版游戏还将大幅增加两人的剧情篇幅，用来具体阐述她们之间的复杂联系。诺耶露不仅将以一名可爱美少女的形象继续自己的故事，还将作为 BOSS …</p>

(对不起走错了)
画惠佳子小姐的关键词，当然是可爱可爱非常的可爱。话虽然这么说，为了尽可能画的可爱点狂找参考，不擅长画妹子的我已经尽力了。


这时候我忽然想到，我忘了关键的一件事：圣子头！于是火速加上。之前的长发版本就作为惠佳子刚出道时青涩的样子吧。
改成圣子头，然后继续完成。


这就是硬汉雨宫庆的一生推！白发老管家的死宅朋友日思夜想之人！新垣里大哥一面之缘就愿意为之赴汤蹈火的可爱女孩子！我们跑团的关键角色！当当当当~~~

                <p>自己前后买过不少坦克和装甲车的模型了，其中也发现了一些规律——二战德系的某些坦克，比如大名鼎鼎的虎I坦克往往有许多厂家都会制作模型，这其中有五十多一个的小号手Easy Model的虎I，也有PM A、Artisan这种几百块的虎I，有时甚至有全内构。不过到了某些型号就少有厂家问津了，比如M36坦克歼击车，只有Hobby Master一家推出过成品，类似的情况如果出现在产品线很短而且也不太愿意复刻的厂家身上，估计就意味着永久绝版。
当然，也有些坦克与战车从未推出过1/72的成品，比如间战期的那些型号，冷战时期像Panzer 61、K1A1或者88式等等，对于这种太冷门的我也不是很报希望有一天会有厂家推出，不过今年倒是意外买到了一款很心仪的冷门战车模型，这就是5M推出的阿奇扎里特战车。


(Mk1)(Mk2)(“水族箱”，也就是机枪后面那个观测台)

阿奇扎里特是IDF为了弥补M113运兵车的致命不足而诞生的重型运兵车，M113的防御力很差，面对最先进的反坦克导弹、路边炸弹和反坦克地雷时很脆弱。而随着梅卡瓦坦克的服役，以色列装甲部队里那些在60和70年代缴获的T-54、T-55坦克势必面临退役。这两个问题折衷一…</p>

              <summary>你从未知道的《魔戒》豆知识</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>《魔戒》也算是众多中文读者涉足西方奇幻领域的开山作了，虽然现在有了中文版的《地海传奇》、《龙枪编年史》和《冰与火之歌》，但《魔戒》的老大地位依然不可动摇。借电影版在国内院线重映的机会，笔者把自己搜集的一些《魔戒》豆知识分享给大家。

为什么托尔金先生会亲自制定一套人名地名翻译规范？
托尔金之所以要制定一个《魔戒》固有名词翻译规范，跟二十世纪五十年代的荷兰文与瑞典文译本的胡乱翻译有关。
瑞典文译本对所有固有名词进行了一番随意的恶搞。瑞文戴尔变成水溪谷，长湖镇变成蜗牛渣，Ered Luin变成月亮山。此外在演绎故事情节和诗歌时自作聪明，这边添一点，那边删一点，帕兰诺平原战役那边更是错漏百出。日耳曼系语言专家托尔金在世时明确多次要求修订译文：“我宁可不太懂瑞典语（托老原话）。”
瑞典本国读者抱怨之声不绝于耳，但瑞典译者自视甚高，拒绝改正。在托老去世后，托老之子克里斯托弗托尔金更是与这位译者划清界限，导致《精灵宝钻》换人翻译。1982年, 这位“大翻译家”的住房发生火灾，他一口咬定这是《魔戒》粉丝干的。干脆特地写了本书，往《魔戒》粉丝和已故的托老身上扣纳粹帽子。
这位瑞典译者的所作所为，如今被记录在英文版、法文版、西…</p>

                <p>在此再次要感谢SUNWING 旭翼文化 的代理（你最近代理的桌游几乎都是我的好球区我简直无力吐槽）。其次在此进行一下最近的桌游开箱的预告，也是我最近的桌游购买的总结。估计这篇文章发布后的一到两天会有一款名叫《废品遗迹》的双人桌游的开箱（旭翼代理），预计（咕咕）到五月中旬至六月初会有keepdry出品旭翼代理（又是你）的《枪与枪》的豪华与普通版众筹版比较开箱，最后是预计六月份能做完的简单桌游代理的《龙王》（原名Colosseum）。
那么废话到此为止，图片流开箱开始。


(废品遗迹)(枪与枪)(龙王)

首先来到外盒，有一说一这个烫金的名字看着是十分的舒服。


其次开合以后是一张旭翼的卡片和棋子牌套（由于已经套上了所以在后面的图片呈现，顺便一说牌套也是预售版赠送，至于后面会不会单独售卖就得看旭翼的了）。


(所以说右下角那两个忍姬棋子能不能考虑一下感觉出)(我想掏钱！！)



(可惜忍姬棋子用的不是下面的233)(你倒是代理啊（震声）想买)



(右下的忍姬棋子可不可以考虑出一下（狗头）)(快点让我掏钱！！)

接下来是棋盘，不得不说碎晶片勾线画出的效果真的赞。


提示卡，没什么好说的。

玩游戏也有环境危害。这看起来是个难以置信的说法，在数码世界享乐怎么可能影响现实呢？但问题出在数码世界的血肉之躯——那些支撑起游戏的电子设备上。
电脑，主机，电力，网络，以及一切兢兢业业地为玩家们提供服务的电子设备们都消耗着昂贵的自然资源与能源。游戏缺少可持续性：玩的过程消耗能源，制作游戏和游戏设备也有相当的危害，玩家群体庞大的基数更加剧了这些负面影响。游戏的可持续性问题还映射出了互联网经济的潜在问题，而互联网用户们对这些问题还知之甚少。
但我们还来得及改变这一切。
游戏与玩家社群中的成员和他们的共同努力促成了改变问题的希望。在游戏公司，玩家，游戏本身当中都不乏先驱者，他们都为绿色游戏付出了各种各样的努力。这些先驱者熟知电子游戏的工业性质并积极与之对抗。他们的贡献就是传递希望的火把。
问题存在……
先从问题说起。玩家群体是一个庞大能源消耗者，从玩家们使用游戏电脑和游戏主机消耗的能源以及玩家的游戏设备配置就可见一斑。美国游戏设备造成的电力消耗甚至要…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>大家好，我是老刘！
为什么把这个math for game develop系列进行搬运翻译？我们大多数人喜欢Unity里面，可视化拖拽的shader编辑器，对于写代码的态度，那是能不写就不写。
但是其实它就是可视化的数学。
当我们提到“数学”，总有先入为主的偏见，大多数人，看见这俩字就头疼。当我们在学校学习“数学”的时候，大多数是因为应付考试，但是时至今日，“数学”对于游戏开发，乃至大数媒领域的工作都至关重要。
我搬运这个系列课程的初衷，就是现在的大学课程，不能覆盖游戏开发行业所需，或者是大数媒领域，你几乎找不到数学在该领域的实际应用性课程。我真诚的希望，通过我们MCATIN译制的这个系列教程，能帮你在这个行业走得更顺，也能走得更远！
汉化不易，希望给我B站账号一键三连，点关注错不了。</p>

                <p>Mole House is a three-storey live-work space in the heart of Hackney, designed as a single-family dwelling for contemporary artist Sue Webster. The project came together as an exercise in excavation and retention, with Webster’s vision for the new home being strongly tied to the history and fabric of the original building. The detached Victorian house was left vacant and derelict after a 40-year long tenancy, held by a resident locally referred to as the Hackney Mole Man.</p>

        Hey PH, thanks for checking out Mosaic 👋 

It's Mike and Muin from Mosaic here. We made Mosaic because we didn't like any of the other existing personal finance apps — and trust us, we tried them all. Most of them have ads, cumbersome UI, and are designed around a one-size-fits-all budgeting system that doesn’t work for everyone.

So we decided to create an app we, the founders, actually enjoy using. So what did we do differently from the other guys?

• No ads, anywhere.
• We don't sell you…</p>

        👋Hey, Producthunt.

📖 Story
As building many side projects, I’ve had to build out the same CRUD APIs repeatedly.  The development time was unnecessarily long and each time we had to make new deployment activities 

I spent approximately more than 40 days building a stable MVP that can do CRDU API and make the custom query efficiently

Fireapis is a no-code platform that allows building APIs in a few minutes without writing any code 🚀.

        Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out Monito.

Monito is a browser extension that aims to simplify the daily work of software testers. It allows monitoring network requests, console logs, user interactions, and navigation events in one place. When testing is done, all the data can be extracted in a single archive. In addition to that, it allows recording a screen, window, or a separate tab. You can also take screenshots anytime.

Over the past 12 months, @fredericgingras and I have been busy building and growing CrewFire - the brand ambassador platform that helps e-commerce brands drive more referrals, word-of-mouth, user-generated content, and engagement, by turning their customers into their army of brand ambassadors on social media (and beyond).

        I made this simple bitcoin opportunity cost calculator because I believe the framework my friends use to assess bitcoin is wrong. They all anchor on the recent price movements and say 'Ahh, I missed the run up, it's too late to buy in now' - so they don't. Sound familiar? 

Using this tool, you can calculate the opportunity cost, in terms of both money and (more importantly) your time, of not buying bitcoin, by comparing it to any of the top 50 tech IPOs of the last decade. This should help …</p>

        I used to love driving around the GTA (Grand Theft Auto) maps as a teenager and listen to the radio stations which had the best music and hilarious conversations i've ever heard from even real life stations.

So I've created GTA Radio as a form of virtual escapism, sit back choose your favorite game and station, and enjoy driving visuals from the game. 

A little dose of nostalgia for GTA fans, in what has become a bloated and stressful world!

                <p>Park Extension is a historically Greek neighborhood that has many small unique detached homes that were often built by the hands of the people who lived in them. The area is a strange suburban enclave amidst an urban fabric that is far denser and less green.

        I developed this product to allow users to create single videos featuring both their front and rear cameras. While they can switch between cameras in one recording, the application does not support shooting videos using both cameras simultaneoulsy, as the Android platform does not allow that.

        Hi 👋

I'm Simon, I made a thing and this is my first launch on ph. I built this following my interests in the stoic philosophy &amp; trying out GPT3 technology. 

One stoic practice involves rewriting the sentiment of an existing quote in your own words, it's really hard. 2000 years ago they nailed the pithy wise quote. I thought maybe gpt3 could help me out. 

You will have to be the judge of whether it's as good as Marcus Aurelius, let me know in the comments.

                <p>&#8220;
        Hey Friends!

In the last half of 2020, I made Cake as a side project when I saw lots of friends and family struggling to collect videos and edit them to make a simple video to surprise them on their special occasion.

I spent a few weeks putting together an MVP and launched it to friends and family in October of 2020.  

Cake lets you collect videos and (if you want) money towards one epic group gift.  You can upload videos directly on the platform, or edit something fun on Tik Tok, Instagr…</p>

        Hi Product Hunt!

My friends and I have long bonded over the ridiculousness of our LinkedIn feeds. We are constantly amazed and confused at the mish-mash of content marketing, thought leadership, and broetry that makes up 90% of our LinkedIn feeds.

So, we thought: why not create our own social network, part fake LinkedIn, part The Onion, part something else, and call it... ShlinkedIn? 

So far it's all been private, but we're excited to open it up to anyone who wants to join today!

Back in the day, I used to run a challenge called "Daily CSS Images." I even appeared on CodePen Radio to talk about it: https://blog.codepen.io/2017/06/06/133-mike-mangialardi/

After getting busy with the whole "finding a career and what you want to do with your life" thing, I've decided to take a swing at another fun challenge.

Since I found out what I wanted to do with my career, I've focused on frontend engineering and gotten caught up in researching the latest patterns …</p>

        18 family members got COVID, 5 had to be hospitalized and 1 passed away - seeing this crisis and lack of resources up close &amp; personal, made me want to start this so we can save as many lives as possible. And in just the last 5 days, with 1M views &amp; 150K users, we've done just that- saved 100s of lives! Grateful for our network of volunteers powering this through!

We’re Toast. 🍞 We’re a dating app that eliminates endless chatting and ambiguity to deliver a more exciting way to date online. 

So, how do we do it? Toast flips the online dating timeline on its head by moving the chat feature to where it matters most: after you hit things off and know that you want to remain in touch.

Yes. We know that feeling all too well.
As professional / hobbyist domainers, entrepreneurs and developers, we have spent time, money and effort in buying many domain names over the years with hope of one day turning our brilliant ideas into reality. But all too often, many domains have stayed un-used and idle.

        Hi Product Hunt,

I like vibing but sometimes I can't because I don't know the lyrics of the song well enough. So I built vibely to change that :)

Vibely is a tool to help you learn song lyrics and take you to vibe town as fast as possible.

Feel free to DM me with any questions on Twitter @amirbolous!

                <p>Tail Latency Might Matter More Than You Think
A frustratingly qualitative approach.
Tail latency, also known as high-percentile latency, refers to high latencies that clients see fairly infrequently. Things like: "my service mostly responds in around 10ms, but sometimes takes around 100ms". There are many causes of tail latency in the world, including contention, garbage collection, packet loss, host failure, and weird stuff operating systems do in the background. It's tempting to look at the 99.9th percent…</p>

                <p>Back in early March, Lukas Böger asked on StackOverflow:
“Where do standard library or compilers leverage noexcept move semantics (other than vector growth)?”
So I got nerdsniped into looking at all the places libc++ tests the noexceptness
of any user-defined operation. This circuitously led to my finding an absolutely massive
number of corner-case bugs in libc++’s string::append member function.
In hindsight, it was a mistake for C++ to use the same keyword for “making a function (conditionally)
noexcept” …</p>

                <p>How I Implemented /dev/printerfact in Rust
Kernel mode programming is a frightful endeavor. One of the big problems with it
is that C is really your only option on Linux. C has many historical problems
with it that can't really be fixed at this point without radically changing the
language to the point that existing code written in C would be incompatible with
it.
